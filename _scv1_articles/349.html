<p>If you could ever go up to a dinosaur and go to it: <i>"You're really
    wierd!!!!!"</i>, what would happen?!?!??!?! Well, it would probably go:
    <i>"Yes, you're right!!!!"</i> Sounds unlikely?!?! Well it turns out that
    dinosaurs are not the gun-metal green/grey we thought they were from films
    like <i>"Jurassic Park"</i>!!!!!!!! In fact, this little article here goes as far as
    saying they looked more <i>"bizzare"</i> than we originally thought!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9810/02/dinosaur.planet.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9810/02/dinosaur.planet.ap/</a></p>
