<p>Now this is quite 
    amusing!!!!! Whilst us lucky Europeans are listening to "What's She 
    Going To Look Like With a Chimney On Her" or something like that, apparently 
    this "techno" lark is new to Johnny Yankee!! <i>"The technology revolution 
    is fueling a cultural revolution whereby artists are creating new music, 
    be it in a recording studio or their bedroom."</i> says some US person, 
    which sounds a bit like something we might have said 10 years ago over 
    here in the UK!!!!!!! What's interesting about this story tho is that 
    fans of techno are apparently using the internet, MP3, online sales, 
    etc., ... So they might be a bit behind us like they were with punk, 
    but at least we won't have to wait too long until a techno equivalent 
    of Green Day comes along!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16764.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/<br/>
