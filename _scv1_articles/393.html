<p>We thought that 
    you only got "Angry of Tumbridge-Wells" type letters in the UK, so we 
    were pleased to see the following letter in the <b>South China Morning 
    Post</b>!!!! Mind you, it's from Hong Kong, which is a former UK colony, 
    so that may explain it!!!!!! Anyway, the letter bemoans the fact that 
    MacDonalds are doing a "Snoopy" doll promotion, and loads of people 
    are buying loadsa stuff from the "Big Mac" in order to get the Snoopy 
    doll, then just dumping the food in the bin!!!!!!!! Sounds like a really 
    great advert for MacDonalds, eh?!?!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/News/letters/letters.html">http://www.scmp.com/News/letters/letters.html</a></p>
