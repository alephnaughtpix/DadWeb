<p>Well, one jolly interesting thing about Britain is that apparently we don't yet have 
    anything about human rights in our constitution!!!!!!!!! So we can get 
    these jolly little stories about people spying on each other in the 
    office!!!!!!! Apparently, your boss could be watching you as you download 
    porn from the internet!!!! Why he doesn't just download it himself is 
    anyone's guess!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_257000/257670.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_257000/257670.stm</a></p>
