<p>Have you ever seen that funny little box they show in a corner of the screen
    on CNN during the Business programmes?!?!?! I'm talking about that box thingy
    that goes "NASDAQ" or "DOW", and then prints a funny number!!!!!! Well,
    wouldn't it be really great if instead of printing all that, it would display
    the latest headlines from Slashdot?!?!?!?! Well, you might interested in
    this!!!!! Some bloke has done a spiffy java proggy, which read various new
    websites, and then displays the headlines, "news-wire" style!!!!! I still
    don't know why he called it <b>"Poseur Interactive Newswire"</b> tho!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.poseur.com/pin.html">http://www.poseur.com/pin.html</a></p>
