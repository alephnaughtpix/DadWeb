title: "Will Blue Peter put their website in their 'capsule' now?!?!?!?"
issue: 24

<p>Remember those old episodes of Blue Peter when they still had Valerie
    Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves on it?!?!??!?!?! They always kept
    doing this thing nearly every year where they'd get some kid from a local
    primary school to sift through their rubbish, and then stick it in a "time
    capsule" which was buried in the "Blue Peter Garden", (What happened to
    that?!?!?! Did they pave it over and turn it into an accounting department or
    something!??!?!?!?!) so that in 25 years, if Blue Peter was still going, the
    presenters would be able to dig it up, and find out what rubbish they used to
    throw out then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Well, now someone at <b>MIT</b> have decided to do a webby version of
    it!!!!!!!!!! This "digital Time capsule" is going to be stored for
    5 years- that may not sound like a lot of time, but in dog years,
    as well as internet years, it's actually quite a long time!!!!!!!!!!!! And
    like the "proper" time capsule, it's mostly filled with complete
    rubbish!!!!!!!!! Check this out: it's going to contain:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"An online guide that helps parents talk to their kids about the
      impeachment of President Clinton, along with an audio clip of his Senate
      impeachment trial, as played over a local radio station's Web site."</li>
<li>"A snapshot of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's 28 January Senate
      testimony on the Net-stock mania, along with portions of Web pages and news
      accounts of the seemingly unrelenting wave of Internet deals.</li>
<li>"A page from online auction house eBay and cyberspace offerings from more
      traditional retailers such as Spiegel and Victoria's Secret. The latter
      hosted a much-ballyhooed webcast of a lingerie fashion show."</li>
<li>"Women-oriented sites such as Advancing Women, a service designed to help
      working women, and Women-Connect-Asia, an online network for women living
      and working in Asia."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>Bet you can't wait to see the reaction when that capsule's re-opened, huh!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17746.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17746.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
