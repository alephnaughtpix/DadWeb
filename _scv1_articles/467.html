<p>As someone who's recently added a CD recorder contraption to their PC, (Which I call James
    Dean, on account of it crashing a lot!!!! As opposed to Godzilla, the machine which actually
    compiles each issue of this esteemed publication!!!!!!!) I find this rather interesting!!!!
    Adaptec &amp; Liquid Audio have teamed up for yet another "music on demand" scheme, but this one
    is different, because it's aimed at people who have CD recorders!!! What happens is that you
    go to this lot's webpage, and download the proggy- this proggy then can allow you to download
    music for a small fee, and burn it onto a CD using your own recorder!!!!!!!!! Of course, you
    could always make up your own chunes and burn them into your own CD etc., ...</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981103/adaptec_li_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981103/adaptec_li_1.html</a></p>
