<p>Internet Telephony is great isn't it?!?!?! Well, if the Internet is clear
    anyway, otherwise you get a syllable per minute if you're lucky!!!!!!! But
    two Swedish companies have apparently come up with some really spiffy way of
    getting around this prob!!! What's really interesting is that the technology
    was developed by Ericsson Telecom and Swedish Royal Institute of Technology,
    who are both Swedish and based in Sweden!!!!!! No Americans were
    involved!!!!! This must be a first!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15434.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15434.html</a></p>
