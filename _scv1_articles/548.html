<p>Have you ever wondered what the Borg do when they have to do the
    shopping?!?!?! Well, according to this lot, you'll be able to find out!!!!!
    Because they're working out how to add wearable computers to the shopping
    experience!!!! Tho we think this might backfire on the shops!!!!! I mean, if
    all this stuff we've been hearing in the past couple of weeks about
    supermarkets in UK being really naughty to everyone and taking all the money
    for themselves, who knows what may happen!!!! The shoppers may suddenly
    decide to "assimilate" them!!!!! </p><p>(Interestingly this story comes from the <b>Las Vegas Sun</b>!!!! We were expecting them
    to blame it all on the Germans and French, but to our surprise, they didn't!!! We didn't
    see any "Page 3" either!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/tech/1998/nov/29/112900230.html">http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/tech/1998/nov/29/112900230.html</a></p>
