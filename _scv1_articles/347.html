<p>Well, they were getting more boring (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...), 
    so we weren't too surprised when we saw that they've been sold off to
    Lycos, the equally boring search engine!!!!! Perhaps they should open a new
    site called <i>"Lycos &amp; Wired's Really Really Boring Website"</i>!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981006/lycos_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981006/lycos_1.html</a></p>
