<p>Well, after all that coment/asteroid-hitting-the-earth business in the
    movies, it looks like we're going to be doing the "deep impact" treatment
    on the "bolides" (Ooh-err!!!) ourselves!!!! NASA is seriously considering a
    plan to send a big copper ball slamming into a comet!!! Probably because
    it's a lot of fun!!!! Unless of course it splits the comet into a few bits
    and a couple of them hit the Earth extinguishing all life!!!!! That wouldn't
    be fun then!!!!!!!1</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16414.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16414.html</a></p>
