    news!!! Read the story below: <i>"Market research company Stanford Resources 
    predict a slow start for flat panel monitors, with CRT (Cathode Ray 
    Tube) monitors remaining the standard until at least 2004."</i></p><p>So flat screen monitors may be common as early as 5-6 years from now?!??!!?
