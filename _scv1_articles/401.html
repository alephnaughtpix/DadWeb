<p>No, it's not what you think!!!!!! It's actually quite small really!!!!!! Look, it's definately 
    not what you think, alright!!!!!! (In my case, it's not small at all 
    actually!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!?!) Anyway, enough talking about you-know-what, 
    I'm actually talking about a real rocket engine that you can fit in 
    you pocket!!!! In fact, you can probably fit quite a few of them in- 
    unless you have really small pockets, or are the size of an atom or 
    something, because these rocket engines are really small- 1.5 centimeters 
    by 3 millimeters no less!!!! The dudes behind this reckon that "array 
    of 800 microrockets (about the size of a hardcover novel) could carry 
    a 1,000-kilogram vehicle into space."- so we could be talking about 
    a rocket the size of a car taking satellites into space?!?!?!?!??!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.techreview.com/articles/nov98/prototype.htm#rocket">http://www.techreview.com/articles/nov98/prototype.htm#rocket</a></p>
