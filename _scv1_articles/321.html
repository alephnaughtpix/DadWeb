<p>Well as we said before (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) one of
    the annoying things about the re-launch of <b>Hotwired</b> was Jon Katz
    getting the order of the Shanks pony!!! So it's good to see he's got a little
    spot on the steadily improving <b>Newstrolls</b> site (See <a href="6.html#192"> 
    issue 6</a>...) !!!!</p><p><a href="http://datanation.com/news/dev/katz/archive/">http://datanation.com/news/dev/katz/archive/</a></p><p>He's also regularly on the <b>Freedom Forum</b> site, where he keeps going
    on about the reporting of that Clinton business...</p><p><a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/">http://www.freedomforum.org/</a></p>
