<p>There's been some conference about digitally faking photos!!! I'm surprised
    they had to wait until digital faking came along to notice that sometimes
    people fiddle about with photies!!!! In the article below, it says something
    about the FBI having "a 14-step program for detecting digitally altered
    photographs"!!!! Presumably step 1 is: "Does it look completely false?"?!?!
