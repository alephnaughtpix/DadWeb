title: "Jon Katz: I don't understand Linux!!!!"
issue: 19

<p>Jon Katz, the "net" columnist whose columns we keep seeing
    everywhere is obviously getting a little out of his normal depth in
    his Slashdot columns, if his latest is anything to go by!!!!! He's
    presumably getting a little irked by the fact that the Slashdot
    format allows people to comment on his columns right next to them,
    and that a lot of the audience know a lot more about computing
    subjects than he does!!!!! So in his latest column he's actually
    asking for help on Linux!!!! He's of course using the opportunity
    to try and apply it to everyone else, and appeal to knowledgeable
    people to not be so snotty and so on... but he's basically asking
    for help!!!!</p><p>Let's hope he gets it!!!! (Oooh-er crickey officer!!!!) After all, 
    his columns are reasonably well written, and are from a different 
    perspective than the usual "net" journo type stuff- so if he can learn 
    a bit more about "techhy" issues, it can only help things, can't it?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/features/98/12/10/1323255.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/98/12/10/1323255.shtml</a></p>
