<p>You might be wondering if the Diamond Rio is going to have any competition in the MP3 player 
    market... To this we can only say: "Yepp!!!!!!!!" That's because *<b>Yepp</b>* 
    is the name of a new range of MP3 players by big Korean dudes, Samsung, 
    which was shown off this week at the International CES held in Las Vegas!!!! 
    What's really interesting about it is that in amongst the range is the 
    first ever consumer MP3 *<b>recorder</b>* we've seen!!!!!! Shame Elvis 
    isn't still around, or they could have have got him to sing "Viva Las 
    Vegas" into it, and it could be released as an MP3 on tha netweb!!!!!!!! 
    That would certainly be good promotion, wouldn't it!!!!!!!!! It's just 
    a shame Elvis kicked the bucket over 20 years ago!!!!!!!! Bet Samsung 
    are kicking themselves!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yepp.co.kr/">http://www.yepp.co.kr/</a></p>
