<p>When you're wanting to protect the plants in your garden against the harsh temperatures 
    of winter, what do you do?!?!?! Well, you might spray your plants with 
    anti-freeze like I do!!!!!!! Unfortunately you might find that the disadavantages 
    (Most of your plants drop dead!!!!!) outweigh the advantages!!!!! (Your 
    home-made tomato juice tastes very much like Austrian red wine!!!!!) 
    Well, it appears in future, we won't need to worry about that!!!!! We'll 
    just need to put jeans on the plants!!!! Well... Not really, but can 
    put special *<b>genes</b>* on them!!!!!!!!! Some really clever scientests 
    have found the gene which prevents plants freezing!!!!!! Which is really 
    interesting, because if I run out of antifreeze when I'm trying to get 
    my Robin Reliant defrosted, I can grow these special plants, and rub 
    them on the car instead!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/067117.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/067117.htm</a></p>
