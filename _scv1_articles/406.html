<p>Wow!!!!! Some scientests have succeeded in using the mighty power of
    quantum physics to acheive what Scotty did in Star Trek!!!!!! By which
    I don't mean they've managed to achieve an anti-matter warp drive powered
    by a Dilithium crystal!!!! In fact, they've managed to teleport something!!!!
    Unfortunately they've only managed to "beam" a beam- of light, that is!!!!
    So at the moment, it only looks like you can Beam Arnold Rimmer Up!!!!!!!!
    Which is a bit stupid really, as he's a hologramme!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ts/story.html?s=v/nm/19981022/ts/teleportation_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ts/story.html?s=v/nm/19981022/ts/teleportation_1.html</a></p>
