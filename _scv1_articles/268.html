<p>While you're running Quake in VIC-20 style GFX, you might be in the mood for
    another retro game!!! Well, how about the very first adventure!??!!? Back in
    the days before you had to shoot at loads of people in
    3d-texture-shaded-funged-virtual-reality engine thingies with big names like
    "Messiah" and "Bigger than Jesus" and so on, adventures were like really
    complex books with no pictures, expect that it was often very hard to turn
    the page!!!! Most of the actual coding in these adventures went into
    super-duper command line programs that tried to understand what the user was
    typing, and how to carefully steer the user into typing only a couple of
    possible things so that they didn't have to code an artificial intelligence
    algorithm, which might not fit too well in a proggy for a 16K Speccy!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, someone's done the very first adventure ever (Done in the days
    when they always played Kraftwerk every time there was something computery
    on the telly!!!) on tha megamighty webby inpho-pipe!!! Yay!!</p><p><a href="http://www-tjw.stanford.edu/adventure/">http://www-tjw.stanford.edu/adventure/</a></p>
