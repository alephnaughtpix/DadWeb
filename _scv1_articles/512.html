title: "What 'Star Wars trailer'?!?!?!?"
issue: 17

<p>Unless you have been on the moon, or sport a not-too-brilliant short-term
    memory, you'll know that this past week the first trailer for the new Star Wars
    movie started appearing in US cinemas!!! Ever since, the trailer's also been
    appearing all over the Internet!!! The most popular versions are the Quicktime
    and AVI files from the official Star Wars website, but we've seen a version of
    the trailer shot in a cinema by some bloke with a camcorder, complete with
    rather appreciative noises coming from the audience!!!</p><p>One of the major groups responsible for spreading the trailer has been the
    dudes from Slashdot!!!!! One of their articles, posted a couple of days after
    the trailer started showing in US cinemas, noted that versions of the
    trailer were available from a couple of sites, and listed them!!!! Then loads
    of people added comments saying that they had mirror sites set up themselves!!!
    So this article suddenly became an index for all the mirror sites to the
    trailer!!!!!! Which is just as well, because due to massive demand, it's almost
    impossible to download the trailer from the official Star Wars site!!!!!</p><p>(Mysteriously enough, this article disappeared from the Slashdot menu the
    very next day!!!!! But the article itself still remained!!!! Perhaps the
    Slashdot lot got a call from a certain film campany?!?!?!?)</p><p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/11/18/0751258.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/11/18/0751258.shtml</a>
<p>The easy availabilty of the trailer on the Internet probably explains why on
    the day after the Slashdot article the bits of the trailer were being shown
    on various TV news programs around the world!!!!!!!</p>
