<p>Anyone remember a "humourous" serial in the jazz magazine Melody Maker about some middle
    class teenager from Essex who was really into hip-hop, acted like he was "from da hood", and
    called himself Cecil G!?!?!?! Well, that's who I'm thinking of when I see the page for this
    crew called "Chuckie Dogg Fresh", who "diss" various "bitches" and other "mo fo" people,
    and advertise their exciting new album "This Shit Is Wack"!!!!!! Let's hope their music
    is "da bomb" and loads of "homies" will "check out" their "wack" sound, and "get down"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/music/HipHop/1514.html">http://www.mp3.com/music/HipHop/1514.html</a></p>
