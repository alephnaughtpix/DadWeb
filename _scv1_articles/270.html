<p>Even without quantum cleverness, technology's getting pretty tiny anyway!!!
    For example, remember those little boxes of plastic stringy stuff that you
    used on Sinclair computers (eg the Speccy and QL) because it was faster than
    tape but not quite as expensive as a hard disk?!?!?! (Ahh, memories!!!
    "Wouldn't it be lovely if I could afford a 'Winchester' drive with THREE
    WHOLE MEGABYTES in it!??!?!?!")</p><p>Well, Microdrives are back, but not courtesy of Sinclair Research, but old
    "Big Blue", who are of course IBM, not a porno website as you may be
    thinking!!!!! And unlike the Speccy Microdrive Class of 1981, it's not under
    a megabyte of magnetic coated plastic stringy stuff, it's actually a little
    hard drive with a capactity of 340MB!!!! It's also a little bit smaller-
    about 1 inch square!!!! So a "Comm badge" with built-in "Universal
    Translator" doesn't look too far away, does it?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/micro/">http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/micro/</a></p>
