<p>They say the cheapest holidays are the ones near you live... But soon
    that'll be a load of crap!!!!!!!! That's because in the future, there will
    be a really stupidly expensive hotel, and it'll only be a couple of hundred
    miles away from you!!!!!!!! That's because it'll be a couple of hundred miles
    upwards... In space!!!!! Yes, this <b>Space Island</b> (Presumably because
    it's like Fantasy Island, expect that it's in space!!!!!!) lot are planning a
    hotel equivalent of the new space station!!!!! Their website's quite
    funny tho!!!!!! On it they "See Earth as God sees it"!!!!!! But if God's
    everywhere, then you already *are* seeing it as God sees it, because God's
    everywhere, and therefore is also where you are when you're seeing
    things!!!!!!! You're just not in orbit round the Earth, that's all!!!!
    Mind you, I didn't know God was in orbit round the Earth as this lot
    appear to be claiming!!!!! Won't he bump into the Space Shuttle or
    something?!?!??!!</p><p><a href="http://www.spaceisland.com">http://www.spaceisland.com</a></p>
