<p>Well, this is an original idea!!!!!!! Someone has set up an online "Virtual Yeltsin
    Health Watch", with pulse readings and things!!!!! So it's a bit like a Tamagotchi, but
    it's Boris Yeltsin!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perhaps, someone ought to do a version for Bill Clinton,
    and then the Republicans can see when his pulse rate goes up a bit!!!!!!!!!!! (Ooh-er!!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://hospital.rulez.net/">http://hospital.rulez.net/</a></p>
