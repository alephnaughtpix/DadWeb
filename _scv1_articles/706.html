<p>Do you ever feel that everyone's "having it off" apart from yourself!??!?!?!?
    Well, don't worry, because there's one "person" whose had more "bangs" than
    anyone else!!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about the Universe!!!!!!! You
    might be thinking: "Wait a sec!!!!!!!!!! Didn't the universe only have one
    really big bang at the start??!?!?!?" Well, er, technically, yes, but
    according to new research, this universe is only one "bubble" that has been
    created out of infinite universe "bubbles" each of which had their own big
    bangs!!!!!!!!!!!!! So we're all the result of an infinite number of
    bangs!!!!!!!! We wouldn't be too surprised if Mary Whitehouse starts
    launching a crusade against astrophysics now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/039/science/Welcome_to_my_universes+.shtml">http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/039/science/Welcome_to_my_universes+.shtml</a></p>
