<p>Well, we've been listening to some of the various unsigned bands on tha netweb, and we've 
    come up with a real corker here!!!!!!!!! Ladies and gentlemen, let us 
    present ... (Drum role!!!!) <b>KTelFunk</b>!!! Isn't that the best band 
    name ever!!!!!!!!! We certainly think so!!!! And their "KTelFunk Theme 
    Song" is really great- it sounds like Fleetwood Mac circa 1971 jamming 
    with 808-State circa 1992- in a school assembly hall!!!!!!! Why don't 
    more people think of such great ideas as this!!!!!!! Their influences 
    are: <i>"Boston, Van Halen, Milli Vanilli, George Michael, Paganini, 
    Django Reinhardt"</i>...</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/music/Funk/267.html">http://www.mp3.com/music/Funk/267.html</a></p>
