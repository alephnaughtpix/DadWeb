title: "Cobblers: hacking British satellite!!!!!!!"
issue: 25
---
<p>Apparently there was some news story last week where some hackers logged onto
    a UK military satellite and wrote "Kilroy woz ere!!!!" or something like
    that!!!! Well, it's a load of cobblers, apparently!!!!!!!!!! 
    At least, so say
    the MOD, who finally bothered to comment on the story on 3rd March after
    loadsa days of "no comment"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The odd thing is that nearly all
    the UK media also went all "no comment" on the story, which first appeared in
    the UK edition of Yahoo News about a week ago, and reported nowhere else in
    the UK media, until this BBC report, quoting the MOD saying it's
    a load of cobblers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Here's the Yahoo story!!!!!!!!!!!

                s=v/nm/19990228/ts/hackers_1.html</a> </p>
<p>And here's the BBC one where the MOD says it's a load of cobblers!!!!!!!!!

<p>Well, that might not be worth reporting, you'd think!!!!!!!!!!! After all, the
    MOD would probably say it's a load of cobblers, wouldn't they, even if it
    wasn't!!!!!!!!!! But some people at a US mag on tha NetWeb, noticing the lack
    of UK investigation, decided to conduct their own!!!!!!!!!!! And they found
    out it was a load of cobblers as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But it's not really well
    publicised!!!!!!!!!! So we'll probably get tons of conspiracy theories
    coming out about this story for years to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
