<p>Now this is interesting!!!! Some combo called "Electronic Disturbance Theater"
    were protesting about something... (Presumably the high levels of boredom
    caused to the American people by a certain "investigation" into whether a
    politician told made-uppies and had a bit on the side, both of which are
    presumably new territory for politiicians!!!!!!!!!!!) Anyway, they did
    this by using a "java" program to do a "sit-in" on the Pentagon
    website!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/14931.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/14931.html</a></p>
