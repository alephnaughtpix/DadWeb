<p>At last, a slightly more interesting trojan horse!!!!!! If, like us, you've been bored with 
    the general trends of viruses since that spiffy "World Cup" one, (See 
    <a href="1.html#18"> issue 1</a>...) then you might find this one interesting!!!!! 
    This one called "<b>picture.exe</b>" which apparently displays a picture 
    or something!!!!!!!!!! But it's really a trojan horse!!!!! What it does 
    is it scans for email address on your hard-drive, and then makes up 
    a list of email addrs from all the data, and posts them to a couple 
    email addrs in China!!!!!!! Why, we don't know- and no-one else knows 
    either!!!!! Exciting, huh?!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,2187419-2,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,2187419-2,00.html</a></p>
