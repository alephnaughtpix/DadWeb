<p>Have you ever got on the internet, and wanted to tell someone about the night you spent
    with Thora Hird?!?!?!?!?!? Well, I haven't!!!!! But according to this article, I should
    have!!!! Apparently the megamighty inpho supey-dupey highway promotes "disinhibition", or
    the opposite of inhibition!!!!!!!!!! So, you're more open online than offline, apparently!!!!
    Which is probably why I got sacked from Radio 1 shortly after I emailed the Controller to
    explain exactly why Shed Seven should not be included on the playlist!!!!!!! (Though I
    still think you can't get more concise than: "They're rubbish!!! What, are you, tone deaf
    or stupid, or something??!?!?!!?!")</p><p><a href="http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/102998/info3_8055_noframes.html">http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/102998/info3_8055_noframes.html</a></p>
