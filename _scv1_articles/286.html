<p>Now this is really funny!!!!!!! As you might know, certain "documents"
    about what the President "did" were put on the Internet in a rather
    clever publicity move by that Starr bloke (No relation to Ringo!!!!).
    Unfortunately the people who always keep going on about the morality
    of the "Prez" have also been the ones who have been pushing the
    "CyberSitter" type software which filters out all the nasty porno and
    "unconventional" ideas.... Yes, guessed it, the software filters out
    those "Zippergate" documents on the web!!!!!!! I think the phrase here
    is "poetic justice"!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14950.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14950.html</a></p>
