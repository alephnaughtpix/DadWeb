<p>If you ever wondered what happened to all those little green men from Mars
    in those movies, then maybe they're trapped under the ice at the poles!!!!
    According to astronomers here, the polar ice caps may have hidden lakes
    underneath them, that might be warm enough to harbour life!!!!!! I wonder
    if it looks like that bit in "The Abyss" that everyone else laughed at?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981023/newscien/909100860-3020677175.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981023/newscien/909100860-3020677175.html</a></p>
