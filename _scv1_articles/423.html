<p>Whoops!!!! I was being <b>de</b>-motivational there!!!!!! I've just seen these rather splendid
    posters which are kind of an interesting response to those "I am bloody brilliant, and getting
    better every day!!!" type stuffs!!!!!! Take a look and see what you think!!!!!! Don't get
    too depressed tho!!!!!! (Funny isn't it!?!?!? I'm *<b>motivating</b>* you to look at these
    posters, and then I'm *<b>de</b>-motivating you by saying that they're depressing!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.fredlet.com/demotivation/pessimism.html">http://www.fredlet.com/demotivation/pessimism.html</a></p>
