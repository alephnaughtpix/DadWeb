<p>As you might have read before, (See <a href="4.html#105"> issue 4</a>...) 
    Linux users have means to record proprietary sound formats... But some Windows 
    users might be saying "Why should Linux users have all the fun!??!?!?" Well, 
    lucky Windows users, you now have the chance to record copyrighted proprietary 
    RealAudio streams using some proggy called X-Get!!!! And it's a legit proggy as 
    well!!! (Well, it's been reviewed by some guy from ZD-net, so it must be legit!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://2bsystem-usa.www-hosting.net/X-FileGet/index.html">http://2bsystem-usa.www-hosting.net/X-FileGet/index.html</a></p><p>Mind you, it's still in a RealAudio format!!!!! Well, we can fix that!!!!!!
    Here's a little proggy which converts RealAudio to WAV files, which can be
    converted into any old format!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.2bsys.com/Ra2Wav/index.htm">http://www.2bsys.com/Ra2Wav/index.htm</a></p>
