<p>Yes, you can't 
    beat 'java/coffee' jokes, can you!??!?! :) :-) :-P Erm, anyway!!!! There 
    was all that talk a couple of years ago about how Java was designed to 
    work in microwaves, telephones, toenail clippers, etc.. , but that quietened 
    down a bit... Until now!!!!!! Sun, the company wot makes Java, has got 
    together with Matsui, who make radiograms, amongst other things!!!!!!</p><p>They're supposed to be working on consumer devices with Java proggys 
    in them!!! Which is really good, because it means in future, if I 
    want to switch on my telly, I just fire up Andrew Ridgley (The name 
    of my Wintel box!!! It used to be called James Dean- until someone 
    pointed out that James Dean only crashed once!!!!!!), log onto tha 
    NetWeb, and access my telly through tha megamighty W3, and tell it 
    to switch on!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29930,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29930,00.html?<br/>
