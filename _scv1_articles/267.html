<p>Quite a lot of friends I know are getting into this Linux lark, and putting
    it on their old PC boxes they made out of 2 year-old PC parts!!! But they've
    not exactly been spoilt for super-duper games!!!! Until now, that is!!!!</p><p>Now you can get Quake- in ASCII form!!!!! Yes, that's right, Quake, with
    all the GFX drawn on a text window!!!! Apparently you need to compile some text
    rendering library with it, but apart from that, go to the URL below, and get
    one of the best games ever released!!!!</p><p><a href="http://webpages.mr.net/bobz/ttyquake/">http://webpages.mr.net/bobz/ttyquake/</a></p>
