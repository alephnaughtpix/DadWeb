<p>Well, they say 
    there are zillions of ways to waste your time on the Internet!!!! (Actually, 
    they don't say that!!!!! I just made it up!!!!!! So it was a bit of 
    waste of your time reading that, wasn't it?!?!?! Which of course, was 
    exactly my point in the first place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
  <p>Anyway, here's one way in which people waste their time!!!!!!! This 
    is a website called "<b>Disgustocollective</b>"- which is against 
    the Internet!!!!!!!!!!!!! We really like the bit where they say <i>"optimal 
    @ 600X800 resolution"!!!!!!!!</i></p>
