<p>Well, if you're like us then you're probably an
    old man who thinks technology is really
    spiffy!!!!!!!!!!!! However, not all older persons are that pro-technology!!!!! Some old
    woman who worked in a post office got sacked this week because she didn't understand
    how to work a new computer they wanted to install in the local post office!!!!!!!! She
    claims that all you really need to work in a post office is a "good brain"!!!!!!! Erm,
    hang on!!!!!! If you've got a good brain, how come you can't learn how to work a flippin'
    computer then?!?!?!?!?
