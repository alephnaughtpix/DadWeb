<p>If you *<i>really</i>* 
    want a different way to browse, how does this grab you- telephone based 
    web browsing!!!! Yes, thank's to these bright sparks, you can now surf 
    da web using voice commands, and then listen to "synthesised" web pages!!! 
    So in future you can shout down the phone: "Get me the latest issue 
    of Senior Citizen, my good man!!!" and, erm, hear it...</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15557.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15557.html</a>
<p>But they'd better watch out, because IBM has developed a Web browser 
    for the blind, which also reads out pages from tha megamighty inphopipe!!!! 
    Let's not also forget that audio style sheets for the web are also 
    being developed... So in future our web page is going to be very noisy!!!!</p>
