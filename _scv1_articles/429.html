<p>Remember those crappy Levis adverts in the 80s where they played that song that goes <i>"Dunno
    much about geology, dunno much about Scientology"</i>, or however it went!!!!!!! Well, if it
    was about these jeans, then that would be the wrong record to use, because these jeans would
    be really bright!!!!!!!!!! Why!??! Well, they're not really jeans, but *<b>genes</b>*!!!! And
    they're bright because they glow in the dark!!!!!! Now we have say that fireflys know how to
    have a good night out- because they've got their "bright jeans" on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (DOH!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_198000/198429.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_198000/198429.stm</a></p>
