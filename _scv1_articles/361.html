<p>Well, whilst reading through a whole load of music newsgroups on Usenet, we've
    been noticing that a lot of young fellows are deciding to put their "demos"
    on the web for the general public to peruse!!!!!! So if you're jealous
    of that Holly person in the <b>Melody Maker</b>, who makes all those sarky
    comments about readers demo tapes, now's your turn!!!!!</p><ul>
<li>
<p>First off is this funny man whose name I've forgotten!!!!! But don't
        worry, my memory's not going!!!!! It's that it's easy to forget who
        it is because he's one of those "singer-songwriter" types!!!!!!
        Anyway, you can download his "art" in mp3 format, but if you can't
        be bothered with that, then it's okay, because he puts the lyrics to
        his songs on the websote!!! And of course, the lyrics are really
        important, because he's a "singer-songwriter" and writes really
        meaningful songs!!!!! So of course loads of people are going to want
        to read song lyrics from a complete stranger they've never heard
        of!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>According to their website, the band <b>Mr Potato-Head</b> are a
        <i>"hoorney"</i> rock band!!!! That's a new category I've never heard
        of before!!!!! But I expect all the big bands will soon be doing
        "hoorney" stuff!!!! So when you hear Damon of Blur saying that there
        was always a "hoorney" element to their bands music, remember where
        you heard it first!!!! Anyway, this is apparently a Dutch "hard rock"
        band who apparently throw really good parties!!!! I wonder if they use
        a "Van Koevering Interactive Piano"?!?!?!?</p>

<p><b>Protocol Productions</b> website has got loadsa frames, GFX, and
        Java stuff, and so take millions of years to load!!!! (Actually, I'm
        exaggerating there!!!!!! It only takes a few minutes really!!!!) Mind
        you, when it does finally load, it looks really nice- like an old
        Amiga A500 demo turned into a website!!! There's lots of info on
        the website about his DJ "Crew", including detailed biogs which
        including their real names, which is really funny!!!!!! Then you
        can toddle over to their RealAudio "Mix" section, and listen to the
        latest "chunky chunes" played by "Darkforce 1 aka Ben Derrickson"!!!!
        Really "Slammin'"!!!!!!</p>
