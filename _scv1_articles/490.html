<p>Conferences are 
    really boring arent't they?!?!??!? I mean, you have to travel halfway 
    across the country, to some really boring conference and then sit around 
    and listen to people talk bollox or look at a whole load of really boring 
    stands at an exhibition!!! Well, there's one conference happening as 
    you read this, where you can listen to people talking bollox and view 
    really boring stands in an exhibition- without moving from your house!!!!! 
    That's because <b>Avatars 98</b> is a *<b>virtual reality</b>* conference!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16192.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16192.html</a></p><p>It's probably not the very first "virtual" conference ever as is 
    claimed here- for example there was an Atari convention (ICC 3) a 
    couple of years ago that took place entirely on the internet using 
    websites, IRC and email, but this is one of the first high profile 
    conferences we've heard of that takes place entirely in various VRML 
    venues!!!!! Perhaps we ought to try this out for a future Senior Dads 
    coding covention!??!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.ccon.org/conf98/index.html">http://www.ccon.org/conf98/index.html</a> </p>
