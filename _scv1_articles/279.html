<p>Do you remember the young persons TV magazine "Look-In"!??!?!? Well, you
    commemorate those years, when the "Tommorow People" and "Magpie" was really
    happenin' (!!!!), in future by looking into a little lazer beam when you
    need some money!!!! This will be because someone's developed a decent way
    of having a retinal scanner built into those funny "hole in the wall" bank
    machines!!!! So they'll recognise it's you from your eyeballs when you "Look
    In" to it!!! Only prob- getting a new PIN is easy, getting a new eyeball is
    a bit more diificult!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com.au/headlines/080998/technology/905259602-3691913139.html">http://www.yahoo.com.au/headlines/080998/technology/905259602-3691913139.html</a></p>
