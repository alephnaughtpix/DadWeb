<p>Remember the good old days when the *<b>Sunday Sport</b>* newspaper gave us
    such classic headlines as <i>"Duuble-decker bus found in South Pole!!!!!"</i>
    and <i>"WW2 bomber found on Moon- vanishes!!!!!"</i> Well, we were extremely
    pleased to see this headline:</p><ul>
<li><b>"Adult Star to Dance Nude on World Wide Web Throughout
        Pregnancy"</b></li>
</ul><p>What's odd is that it didn't come from the Sunday Sport, but <b>Yahoo Business
    News</b>!!!!! Obviously those stocks 'n' shares spots aren't getting enough of
    an audience!!!!!! Anyway, apparently the "adult star" (Well, I would be
    extremely worried if it was a little kid!!!!!!!) is <b>Tabitha Stevens</b>,
    who has presumably changed quite a lot from when she appeared as a kid on that
    lovely family show <b>Bewitched</b>!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980930/tabitha_st_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980930/tabitha_st_1.html</a></p>
