<p>The lot who brought you the Monica Lewinsky scandal have done it again!!!!!!! And like that,
    this story is quite amusing, but we'll probably be absolutely completely sick of it by this
    time next year!!!!!!!!!</p><pre class="usenet">
MON NOV 02, 1998 22:08:08 UTC -- According to ABC NEWS' website,
Davis is the new governor of California with 2,136,058 [49%] over
Lungren 1,982,820 [46%]! Sen. Boxer has received 2,155,456 [50%]
over Matt Fong's 1,916,746 [45%] and Boxer has been elected to
another term in the U.S. Senate. Fitzgerald has easily won over
Moseley-Braun in Illinois! [57%/42%]! And Al D'Amato has beat
Schumer in New York City! 1,765,114 50%/1,475,697 42%!

And ABC is reporting all of this -- and hundreds of other returns --
EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST VOTE HAS BEEN TAKEN!

In what will clearly go down as the one of the biggest Internet
mistakes of all time -- ABC NEWS has suddenly started to report
Election Day results -- before Election Day.

A spokesman for ABC NEWS was not immediately available for comment.

The DRUDGE REPORT found the Election '98 results at:

<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/senate.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/senate.html</a>
<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/governors.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/governors.html</a>
<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/issues.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/issues.html</a>

The ABC numbers are being mirrored at:

<a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/abc3.htm">http://www.drudgereport.com/abc3.htm</a>

"I can't believe that ABC has done this!" declared a horrified
senior staffer in Matt Fong's senate campaign office late Monday
night.

"Do they really hate republicans that much that they would fake the
results and put them on their website! They should be sued by
everyone they already show losing!"

The charges are explosive!

It is not clear what ABC NEWS hoped to achieve by releasing
"Election Results" on the Internet a day before the election.

One ABC NEWS source in Washington, who demanded anonymity, was
completely floored when showed the website returns:

"This looks very serious. I'm calling [ABC NEWS President David]
Westin."
