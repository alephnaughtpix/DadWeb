<p>Remember when we had a good laugh at those silly Americans for seeing sinister
    motivations behind the Teletubbies?!?!?! (See <a href="14.html#409"> issue 14</a>...)
    I made some flip comment about UK viewers seeing similar motives in Barney the
    Dinosaur!!!!!! Well, guess what I saw in an issue of the Scotsman today (24/11/98)!
    ??!?! Apparently, quite a few parents don't like Barney, and think it's an unsuitable
    role model for the kids!!!!! And the article mentions a lot about all the anti-Barney
    resources on tha netweb!!!!!</p><p>Now, you would have thought that this article would have therefore been an obvious
    candidate for the Scotsman's online web edition, but no!!!! And there's not a trace
    of the story in <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/">http://www.scotsman.com/</a> !!!! 
    There isn't even a mention of it in the Scotsman's Yahoo News section in
    <a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/</a> !!!!! 
    Talk about missing the point!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/News_and_Media/Television/Shows/Children/Barney/Anti_Barney/">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/News_and_Media/<br/>
