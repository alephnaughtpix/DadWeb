<p>Over here, we 
    had Wogan, but in the US, there are a whole load of talk show hosts 
    who pretend like they're really funny or something!!!! In fact, I saw 
    one last night on my new fangled cable box called "David Letterman", 
    who was really terrible!!!!!! (I'm talking about the talk show, you 
    idiots!!! Not the cable box!!!!!!!!!! Calling a cable box "David Letterman" 
    would be really stupid!!!!!! Unless it was really unfunny!!!!!!) And 
    according to this article, a lot of the really unfunny "monologue" stuff 
    in last week's talk shows was ripped right off the Internet!!! But look 
    at the end bit... Now look at the headline on our last issue!!!! (See 
    <a href="15.html#"> issue 15</a>...) We know you're reading this, Tom, 
    so read this- stop ripping us off!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16106.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16106.html</a></p>
