<p>Remember in the early 1980s when modems had those big sucker thingies that
    you stuck the phone handset to!??!?!!? They called them acoustic modems,
    presumably because they vaguely looked like the basic shape of an acoustic
    guitar!!!!!!! Well, they're back!!!!! Kind of!!!!!!!! Enter this brillibobs
    "personal organiser" palmtop type thingy- you can stick a mobile phone onto
    it, and the palmtop can then dial onto the netweb, and download your
    mail!!!!!! And it doesn't even look remotely like an acoustic guitar!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.jvc-america.com/pocketmail/pocketmail.html">http://www.jvc-america.com/pocketmail/pocketmail.html</a></p>
