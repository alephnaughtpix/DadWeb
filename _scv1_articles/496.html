<p>According to this 
    UK Net survey, a lot of people in the UK think that the internet is 
    still a lot like "Killer Net"!!!! Only, unlike most people, they're 
    taking "Killer Net" seriously, and not as the corking parody of bad 
    "Net" programmes that it really is!!!!! Apparently they think tha mighty 
    inpho-webby thingy corrupts morals, and is devoted to pictures of people 
    "doing it"!!!!!!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_212000/212650.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_212000/212650.stm</a></p>
