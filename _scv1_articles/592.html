<p>One thing that 
    always makes Xmas is comedy!!! Well, we think we've found the "Only 
    Fools &amp; Horses" of the net for this Xmas!!!!! The ultimate wacky conspiracy 
    site, <b>The Konformist</b>, is even funnier tho, because they take 
    it incredibly seriously!!!!!! We've actually seen a serious examination 
    of the charge that the Spice Girls are part of a worldwide brain-washing 
    conspiracy!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Now that there's this "conflict" business with Iraq, the mailing 
    list is going overtime on it's conspiracy theories!!!!!! And it's 
    really hilarious!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.konformist.com/">http://www.konformist.com/</a></p>
