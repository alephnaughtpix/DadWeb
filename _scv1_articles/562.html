<p>Well, we've heard of some strange fan pages before, (Such as that
    Mr T one, eh Mike?!?!?!?) but this takes the biscuit- and the scone
    with jam in it as well!!!!!!!) If you remember that "Webpad"
    thingy that we mentioned not so long ago, (See <a href="18.html#537">issue 18</a>...)
    well, someones made a whole fansite for it, and other similar
    websurfing little computes!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.padsurfer.com/">http://www.padsurfer.com/</a></p>
