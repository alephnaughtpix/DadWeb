<p>Well, it's great to see that when 2000 comes around, not all of us will be playing gigantic 
    3D texture-phong-shade-mapped Quake XVVXIIIVa type games!!!!!! Some 
    are going to be playing pinball!!!! At least this lot think so!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Because they've launched a pinball machine called <b>"Pinball 2000"</b>!!!!!! 
    On this web page, they say : <i>"Introducing Pinball 2000, the most 
    TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED pin the world has ever seen."</i> Which of 
    course is not really interesting to most people, as they want to know 
    about the pinball machine!!!!!! I mean, who's really interested in knowing 
    about the pins holding it together?!?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.pinball2000.com/home.html">http://www.pinball2000.com/home.html</a></p>
