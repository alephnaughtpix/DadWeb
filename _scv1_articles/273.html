<p>If you're not got depression from Internet usage as reported in that
    "HomeNet" survey, (See <a href="8.html#239"> issue 8</a>...) then you're
    probably going to get really depressed at the reaction to it over the past
    week, which has generally been either "No, we're not!!!!" or the sort of
    somophoric bollox that I last saw when I first came on the Internet in the
    early 90s, and it was dominated by "Age of Aquarius" type tracts from ageing
    hippy types based on The Well!!!</p><p>Probably the best article of the week was from Salon, who at least 
    still have the "media" articles that Hotwired used to have!!! (See 
    <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) Their story pokes quite a few 
    holes in statistics of the HomeNet study, including pointing out (As 
    I did last week!!!!) that the actual figures are pretty trifling anyway!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/rose/1998/09/03straight.html">http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/rose/1998/09/03straight.html</a></p><p>More discussion of the whole thing....</p><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/tech1.htm">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/tech1.htm</a></p><p>Then someone let the bloody philosofers in on the act!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/090598/info8_14386_noframes.html">http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/090598/info8_14386_noframes.html</a></p>
