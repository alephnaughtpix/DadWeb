<p>Well, it appears that October 1998 is State The Bleeding Obvious Month in Internet reporting 
    terms!!! (See <a href="12.html#356"> issue 12</a>...) But here's something new!!!!!! Apparently 
    internet veterans surf tha w3 differently to newbies!!!!! And some people 
    even listen to music whilst surfing!!!! At least so says a presumably 
    really expensive survey mentioned in this story, but I wouldn't believe 
    it- it sounds just so ultra hyper wacky!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15538.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15538.html</a></p>
