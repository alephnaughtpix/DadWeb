<p>Well, we were impressed with the way the <b>Newstrolls</b> has grown since it was a thread
    on the HotWired bbs!!!! (See <a href="6.html#192"> issue 6</a>...) Already, the sites has grown from 
    just a daily list of news-related URLs to include loads of regular columns!!! But even we were 
    surprised when they actually had their own news story!!!!!!! It's about side-affects for a new 
    vaccine or something, but it certainly is a start!!!!!! How long before Newstrolls becomes the 
    Reuters of the Internet?!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/CJ/vaccine/103098.htm">http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/CJ/vaccine/103098.htm</a></p>
