<p>Well, this is interesting!!!!!!!!! While over here in Europe, pop stars
    such as The Corrs have been giving us sob stories about how the MP3 format is
    depriving them of record sales, (Though in the case of The Corrs, I think it
    might have something more to do with their music!!!!!!!!!! I certainly have no
    desire to download an MP3 of their rubbishy Ballykissangel/Lighthouse
    Family type crapola!!!!) in the US, the major labels are going to be testing
    actual digital music sales!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course, it's not really MP3 they're
    using, but a more "secure" method... It is however being backed by Warners, Sony,
    Universal, EMI, and the "Bertelsmann Music Group", whoever they are!!!!!!!!!
    So it looks as though the majors are trying to catch up with all those
    forward-thinking MP3 peeps!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/02/biztech/articles/09blue.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/02/biztech/articles/09blue.html</a></p>
