<p>Well, you might have vaguely remembered that little privacy argument over Pentium IIs 
      and their serial numbers!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="23.html#676"> issue 
      23</a>...) Intel said it could be switched "off" by one of their clever 
      programs, but as the number is still there, it would only take someone 
      to work out how to switch it back "on" again!!!!!!!! And that "person" 
      is the old German computer mag, <b>C'T'</b>!!!!!!!! They've now proved 
      that even with the number switched "off", software can still switch 
      it back on and read it!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Intel are now doing a "fix", wherw the BIOS makes sure the number 
    is kept "off", but firstly that only works at bootup, so some company 
    could still read your serial no. in the meantime!!!!!! And what's 
    more, your BIOS can also be re-programmed to not switch the number 
    off!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/english/99/05/news1/">http://www.heise.de/ct/english/99/05/news1/</a></p>
