<p>As they say, you can always trust the man who produced the final
    Nirvana album!!!!! This very informative article, by <b>Steve Albini</b>,
    the man behind that delighftul band <b>Rapeman</b>, tells you of all the
    pitfalls that can befall you if you sign with a major record label!!!!
    One very interesting part is when he mentions that crappy little pieces
    of paper can be used as legal documents, so that a record company can
    conceivably muck around with a band even before they've signed an actual
    proper contract with them!!!!! Basically, then entire article can be
    summarised in the following 3 words: "Major Labels: avoid!!!!!"!!! But
    then again, if it was just 3 words, it wouldn't be such an entertaining
    article, would it?!?!?!?!??!</p><p><a href="http://www.atlantic-satellite.com/major_la.htm">http://www.atlantic-satellite.com/major_la.htm</a></p>
