<p>OK, OK, we saw this in <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a>,
    but it's too good to miss!!! There are people around who are messing around
    with Nintendo Gameboys, and have come up with a <b>Gameboy Technology</b>
    page with stuff like Gameboy to PC interfaces, and uses for the new Camera
    and Printer add-ons!!!! Pretty neat-o yummy technology as they might say
    in some geeky ezine from the US!!!!</p><p><a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~jfrohwei/gameboy/">http://home.hiwaay.net/~jfrohwei/gameboy/</a></p>
