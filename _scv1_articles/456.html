<p>You know they say about certain stories: "It could only happen in America!!!!!" Unless of
    course, it didn't happen in America, in which case it would be a bit silly!!!!!!!! I mean,
    you wouldn't exactly talk about the ferry services to the Shetland Isles, and then say "It
    could only happen in America!!!!!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That would be really
    dim!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Erm, well, anyway!!!!!! The point is- there's also a type of story that "could only happen
    in Scotland!!!!! And that's because we've got wierd stuffy newspapers up here in Scotland,
    which for some odd reason pretend to be really patriotic and salt-of-the-earth-working-class,
    even though they're actually quite right-wing and written by out-of-touch "Voice of Reason"
    types!!!!! Which is really suprising, as they're all owned by gigantic "Ruper Murdoch" style
    media corporations!!!!!!! Oh no, I'm going off on a tangent again...!!!</p><p>Anyway!!!!!! The sort of story I'm talking about are the sort of semi-humorous "Wha's Like
    Us?!??!" type piece that's usually about some unique piece of "Scottish colour", like some
    Rangers fan complaining about the council painting his fence green, or vice versa, or
    someone going on about Scotland excelling in something really insignificant!!!!!!!! In short,
    anyone who makes Scots look like a bunch of prats, you'll see it first in the Daily Record!!!!!
    (The Daily Record is a tabloid which was a right-wing Tory paper in the 50s, then suddenly
    became a right-wing Labour paper in the 60s, anticipating the Sun's recent change of
    direction by more than 30 years!!!!!!!!!!) Dammit, I'm still ranting again!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, here's the really really silly story!!!!!!!!!! Apparently a recent piccy of some
    nebula has a dark area which just happens to resemble the basic outline of a map of
    Scotland!!!!!!!!! So what, you may think, but it managed to fill most of a page in the
    Daily Record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981102/drecord/910008010-a0211803.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981102/drecord/910008010-a0211803.html</a></p>
