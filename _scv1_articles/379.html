    Name Generator</b> is a really great invention which chucks out loads 
    of random names for those people who don't know what to call their band!!!!! 
    Before long, we can expect to see the following names in the hit-parade... </p><pre>Whiskey Bacon Iris
Crap Atom
Hideous Diamond Carpet
Sprocket Consumption
Rerun Yeast Cellar
Pink Bacon Angry
Reckless Ink Harp
White Devil Lobster
Captain Lighter Crispy
Burgundy Madness Anarchists
