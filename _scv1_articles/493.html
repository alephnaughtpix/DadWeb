<p>Remember in the 
    old days during the summer holidays when the BBC always used to put 
    programs on in the morning for children like "Why Don't You...? (Just 
    Switch Off Your Television And Go Out And Do Something Less Boring Instead?!?!?)" 
    (Which I always did at that point, because it was a really boring programme!!!!!) 
    and one of those "cliff-hanger serials" with "Buster" Crabbe in them, 
    usually playing Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers!!!!! (And I bet you thought 
    that part was invented by Glen A Larson!!!!!!!) And at the same time, 
    there was this sci-fi comic strip series in the Daily Record (See <a href="15.html#456"> 
    issue 15</a>...) called "Lance McLaine" which was exactly 3 pictures 
    long every day, and made absolutely no sense whatsoever!!!! Well, now 
    you relive those times with this website, which serves up a daily sci-fi 
    adventure- and just in case it doesn't make any sense, you can check 
    out the archive for the previous stories!!!!! Daily Record, please take 
    note!!!!!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://www.bitbooks.com/">http://www.bitbooks.com/</a></p>
