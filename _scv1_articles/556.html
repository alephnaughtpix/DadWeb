<p>Well, that <b>Zine 
    98</b> conference might be over, (See <a href="16.html#491"> issue 16</a>...) 
    but the site's still up!!!! And it's been re-designed, which is just 
    as well, as the original design was a bit obtuse, to say the least!!!!! 
    We've managed to get listed in their directory, despite us questioning 
    the logic of their organising a convention for onlien zines in a completely 
    non-online setting!!!!!! Mind you, they also listed <b>Need To Know</b>, 
    who really slagged the conference off!!!!! What's really funny is that 
    our zine is listed under "Wacky Shit"!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.webzine98.com/zinedirectory.html">http://www.webzine98.com/zinedirectory.html</a></p>
