<p>Now this is a top site in our humble opinion!!!!!!!!!!! The Bad B-Movies site contains reviews of really brilliant movies like "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "The Evil Dead II"!!!!!!!!!!! Even better, they've got reviews of loads of films we've never heard of!!!!!!!! Such as"Rock 'n 'Roll Frankenstein" - "Record producer and mad scientist create a rock star from the parts of Elvis, Jimmy Hendricks, and - by accident - Liberace."</p><p><a href="http://www.badmovies.org/">http://www.badmovies.org/</a></p>
