<p>What's the connection between Geoffrey Boycott (No, not Geoffrey from
    Rainbow!!!!!!!) and the medical tricorder from Star Trek?!?!?!? Well, it's
    cricket!!!!! Now, if this has you "stumped" (DOH!!!!!), let us explain!!!!!
    Those wonderful people from <b>MIT</b> aev come up with these little boxy
    robots called <b>Crikets</b>, which can be programmed in that quaint
    little computer language called <b>Logo</b> that you probably remember
    from those BBC Microcomputers in school in the olden days... They can
    also communicate with each other as well!!!! Apparently they're being
    considered for medical applications or something like that...</p><p><a href="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/people/fredm/projects/cricket/">http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/people/fredm/projects/cricket/</a></p>
