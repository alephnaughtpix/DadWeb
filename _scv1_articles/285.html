<p>Well, if I was to report all the "big name" websites that got hacked and
    "naughty" things written all over it, I wouldn't ever get a flippin' issue
    finished!!! But this is a little exception!!! One morning MTV's website
    suddenly had "JF was here" plastered all over it!!!!! JF is the initial
    of a famous dude in a famous hacking crew, so quite a few people said "Aha!
    MTV's been hacked!!!!" I bet you can guess what's coming next!!!!!! Yep, it
    was actually an "ironic" "hoax" "publicity" "campaign" thingy, and was a
    complete made-uppie!!!!! My, how we laughed!!!!! Well, we did- it seems
    not very many other people were impressed, especially real-life hackers!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14914.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14914.html</a></p><p>AntiOnline not too pleased judging from this response!!!! Mind you, I find
    the bit where they accuse MTV of glorifying hacking a bit amusing!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.antionline.com/SpecialReports/mtv/opinion.html">http://www.antionline.com/SpecialReports/mtv/opinion.html</a></p>
