<p>    In an episode I saw recently of that jolly "tech" series "<b>Bugs</b>", some
    young teenage "hacker" person hid an ancient Mayan mask inside a loudspeaker
    on display in Dixons!!!!!! Well, in future that might not be a good idea, for
    two reasons:</p><ol>
<li>The loudspeakers wouldn't have any insides!!!!!!!!!
    <li>Even if you put the mask inside the loudspeaker, you would still be able to see it!!!!!!!!!
  </li></li></ol><p>That's some really clever people have invented transparent speakers that can be 
              stuck on glass or plexiglass!!!!!!!!! So in future you'll go to concerts, 
              and the speaker columns will look like an office block!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ap/technology/story.html?s=v/ap/19990301/tc/britain_seethrough_speakers_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ap/technology<br/>
