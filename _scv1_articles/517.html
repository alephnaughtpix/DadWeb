<p>Remember that funny little browser called <b>Opera</b>, that was meant to be
    like Netscape and IE, but smaller and faster?!?!?!? Well, it's still
    going!!!! In fact, they've just released a new versh of Opera, which includes
    support for style sheets!!! So now you can run a web browser called Opera-
    and look at a website about opera!!!!!!! You'll probably have to make the
    window a bit bigger tho, if you want to fit Pavarotti into it!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/prod-news/1998/11/1801-opera.html">http://www.internetnews.com/prod-news/1998/11/1801-opera.html</a></p>
