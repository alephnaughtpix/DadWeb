<p>Now, you might 
    be used to the "AM"-like sound quality of RealAudio, but if you've tried 
    to actually get visual stuff going on your player, you'll know that 
    the resulting pictures look a little like what you would get if you 
    filmed the televison on a cheap camcorder with a plastic bag over the 
    lens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, apparently some people called <b>High 
    Speed Net Solutions</b> have fixed that problem with a way of sending 
    much clearer pictures over tha NetWeb with an average frame rate of 
    30 fps!!!!! Apparently it uses "wavelet-based technology" or something 
    like that!!!!!!! What with this, and Shoutcast challenging RealAudio's 
    dominance of streaming audio, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</a>...) 
    it looks like RealNetworks are going to have to pull their socks up!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    (Which, as some of you might say, is a little rich coming from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) </p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990201/fl_high_sp_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990201/fl_high_sp_1.html</a></p>
