<p>Well, this is 
    another interesting "Best of the web" type mailing list, but we really 
    dig that name: "<b>Internet Tourbus</b>"!!!!!!! That's almost as good 
    as "Van Koevering Interactive Piano" (See <a href="12.html#352"> issue 
    12</a>...) And the subtitle is really great as well!!!! <i>"Why Surf 
    When You Can Ride The Bus?"</i>!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.TOURBUS.com/">http://www.TOURBUS.com/</a></p>
