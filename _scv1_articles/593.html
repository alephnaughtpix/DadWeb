<p>Well, here's a 
    bit of a surprise!!!!! The ninth Star Trek film "Insurrection" has been 
    trashed in a review on Slashdot!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/features/98/12/13/1028244.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/98/12/13/1028244.shtml</a></p><p>However, a lot of people are also going on about some supposed "curse 
    of odd-numbered films" with Star Trek!!! After all, Star Trek 3 was 
    a load of bull, and as bad as Trek 5, wasn't it!??!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2652#23451">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2652#23451</a></p>
