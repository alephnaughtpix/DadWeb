<p>Have you ever lost your baggage in transit?!?!??!?!?! Well, someone in Swindom
    might buy it, thanks to the megamighty power of tha InphoPipeway
    NetWeb!!!!!!!!!!!! And it's all thanks to this wonderful <b>Unclaimed
    Baggage</b> website!!!!!!! Apparently they buy all this unclaimed baggage
    stuff, which is apparently at really cheap prices!!!!!!!!! Then they sell it
    on this website for only slightly more expensive prices!!!!!!!!!!!!! So it's it
    bit like the webby equivalent of Delboy!!!!!!!! Though obviously the unclaimed
    baggage hasn't fallen off any lorries or anything like that!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/home.htm">http://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/home.htm</a></p>
