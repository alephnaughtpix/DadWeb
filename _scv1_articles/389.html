<p>We've recently 
    found one of the best sites ever on the internet- a latter-day equivalent 
    of the "Cool Site of the Day" type thingy done years ago!!!! Only this 
    one lists sites that are dead, or haven't been updated for years!!!! 
    The real specialities are short-term websites knocked up for movie publicity!!!!! 
    This week, there's a review of the <b>Mission Impossible</b> website!!!!!!! 
    Really brillibobs, eh?!?!?!?!? </p><p><a href="http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/">http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/</a></p>
