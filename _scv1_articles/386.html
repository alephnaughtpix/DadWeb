Peter Mandelson announced this week that the Millenium Dome will
feature a very special testament to the British Porn Industry,
called the "Adult Zone." Televisions thoughout the brotheliimeancomplex
will show 24 runs of Television X, The Adult Channel and Playbox TV.
Also a large 24 foot vibrating penis will be erected, to demonstrate
the effect of the sex-toys industry on the world. Free Viagra will be
availible also.

(British Satirical Broadcasting. A weekly look at the news in some way or
another.Nothing to do with the Backstreetboys. Go there, whilst you have
half a life.

BTW, the sites currently in beta stage. Any comments will be very much
appreaciated.
