<p>Well, no doubt 
    whilst reading this spiffy issue of Senior Citizen, you are probably 
    using the mouse very vigourously!!!!!!! But, you'd better be careful, 
    or else it may have a heart attack!!! That's because it may be older 
    than you!!!! Unless you're over 30 of course!!! Yes, that's right- the 
    mouse was invented 30 years ago this week!!!!! And it's being written 
    up in a whole load of people, most of whom probably thought trackballs 
    were really brilliant 10 years ago!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16752.html">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16752.html</a></p>
