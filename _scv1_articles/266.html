<p>Well, the problems 
    between sample combo Negativland and the record industry (See <a href="8.html#246"> 
    issue 8</a>...) seems to be fixed now, and it's actually a bit of a 
    revolutionary settlement!!! As reported last week, Negativland found 
    that their new album wasn't getting pressed by CD plants, apparently 
    on the orders of the Recording Industry Association of America, because 
    of all their sampling!!! Now the industry have reached a sort of agreement 
    about the "grey areas" of using samples of other peoples songs in original 
    compositions... Although this idea has been kind of understood for years, 
    this is actually the first time it has been recognised officially by 
    a record industry body!!! So this is actually a rather important decision, 
    which will fundamentally affect the various copyright issues around 
    sampling!!!! Well done, Negativland!!!!</p><p><a href="http://rl.sonicnet.com/news/archive/story.jhtml;$sessionid$WAK5TTAAABXMHUID1AKCFEQ?id=500942&amp;pid=502275">http://rl.sonicnet.com/news/archive/story.jhtml;$sessionid$WAK5TTAAABXMHUID1AKCFEQ?id=500942&amp;pid=502275</a></p><p>Negativland's lovely little website is at</p><p><a href="http://www.negativland.com/">http://www.negativland.com/</a></p><p>...
