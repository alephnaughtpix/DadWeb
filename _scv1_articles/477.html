<p>Well, when Jerry Lewis was singing "Great Balls of Fire" (!!!!! Ooh-er!!!!!!!!!!!)
    I bet you didn't know it was about the potential for an explosive
    chain-reaction due to overabundance of helium resulting from a hydrogen-rich
    nuclear fusion reaction on a stellar scale!!!!!! Well, look at this
    impressive piccy and see if you can't see what the great ragtime 50s rocker
    was going on about!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/38/">http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/38/</a></p>
