<p>There's this spiffy keyboard thingy called The "Van Koevering Interactive
    Piano", which allows you to compose, edit compositions, and print them
    out!!!! But that's boring!!!!!! We're really interested in the name: "Van
    Koevering Interactive Piano"!!! Really cool, huh?!?!? Remember where you
    heard it first, because we're sure by the end of the year the phrase
    "Van Koevering Interactive Piano" will be on everyone's lips!!!!!! I
    imagine loads of kiddies will be writing letters to Santa saying
    <i>"please please please Santa, can I have a 'Van Koevering Interactive
    Piano'?!?!?!?!?!"</i></p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/981006/ia_van_koe_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/981006/ia_van_koe_1.html</a></p>
