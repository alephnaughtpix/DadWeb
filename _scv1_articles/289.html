<p>Phew!!!! The phrase "storm in a teacup" could have been invented for this
    absolute non-story!!!! But I'm not talking about President Clinton now!!!</p><p>Some people have been complaining about the state
    of <a href="news://alt.digitiser">news://alt.digitiser</a> !!! Apparently the newsgroup devoted to the UK
    Teletext "mag" <b>Digitiser</b> has got a large "noise-to-signal"
    ratio, contains a lot of chit-chat which is not really relevant to Digitiser,
    and has the odd people flaming back and forth!!!!</p><p>Well, for most older Usenet hacks like me, it was a cause for celebration, as
    those were all the old cliches of an alt.* newsgroup, and it would mean that
    after many months it was finally an established newsgroup!!!! But some of
    the "newbies" have been thinking that the newsgroup is "dead" or something
    ridiculous like that!!!! Of course, it's in a bit of a quiet period because
    it's between Uni terms, and so a lot of the regular Digi fans don't have
    access to email, but matters seems to have come to a head at the end of
    last week when some person called "zygotes" sent an email to an awful lot of
    people saying he "deleted" the newsgroup!!!!!! Well, I didn't notice any
    difference at Deja News!!!!!! It later turned out to be a bit of a mess-up,
    and "zygotes" apologised, but the kerfuffle, a few people announced the
    group was dead and that they were leaving, and then "contraversial" journalist
    Stuart Campbell wrote a "outspoken" message saying he was leaving as well,
    blaming messages by a couple of people who had left the newsgroup long
    ago!!!!!</p><p>To be honest I can't what all the fuss is about!!!! You "headless chicken"
    types really ought to relax, and take up Transcendental Meditation, like
    that young chap Willie Hague!!!!</p><p>Zygotes mk 1: "I'm 'hard'!!! I can delete newsgroups!!!!!"</p><p><a href="text/zygotes.txt">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/features/citizen/text/zygotes.txt</a></p><p>Zygotes mk 2: "Ohhhh, I'm so sorry, I can't delete newsgroups after all!!!!"</p><p><a href="text/zygotes2.txt">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/features/citizen/text/zygotes2.txt</a></p><p>Stuart Campbell mk 1 on alt.digi: <i>"I think it's one of the more pleasing
    newsgroups on Usenet - it's popular and dynamic, and reasonably often sees
    some genuinely interesting and intelligent discussions about games topics.
    I certainly think it was worth getting it created."</i>

<p>Stuart Campbell mk 2 on alt.digi sucks: <i>"We tried to give Digi readers a
    forum to have fun talking about Digi and games and stuff generally with Digi
    writers and fellow readers, and got mostly a load of irrelevant juvenile
    drivel, with the few worthwhile bits coming mostly from people who've now
    been driven away by the weariness of ploughing through all the shit.
    Therefore, I'll be joining Uncle Biffo in sodding off and leaving you all to
    shout it out amongst yourselves."</i></p>

<p>Now my tupenny worth... It seems to me that the group didn't die because of
    any crap messages or general irrelevance, because you get that in nearly
    any flippin' newsgroup!!!! It looks to me like the newsgroup's just died
    merely because enough people have believed it to be dead!!!! I haven't seen
    any appreciable drop in quality or otherwise in the messages, but suddenly
    everyone's talking like alt.digi's dead and the suddenly the number of
    messages drop like a stone!!!!! If I were the "coroner", I'd say alt.digi
    has just died of "mass hysteria"!!!!! Mind you, with the college terms
    now starting. I wouldn't surprised if we get a couple of old faces back
    going "Duh, what happened?!?!?!"</p>
