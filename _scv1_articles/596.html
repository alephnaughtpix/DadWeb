<p>Now, from Y2K 
    to NTK!!!!! (That was a good link, wasn't it?!?!?) those lovely people 
    at <b>Need To Know</b> ezine-world, have decided to stop moaning about 
    the UK cryptography policy, and do something about it!!!!! They've set 
    up this little site where you can "adopt" an MP, and... then they're 
    going to something unspecified in the very near future with all these 
    "adoptions"!!!!!! Probably get us to add our names to an email, and 
    then send them all off at the same time, sending zillions of emails 
    to every MP, and probably giving the government email system a bit of 
    headache!!!!</p><p>We think this is a very good idea, so we say take a trip along to 
    their site!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.stand.org.uk/">http://www.stand.org.uk/</a></p>
