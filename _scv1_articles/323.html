<p>This is a real bummer!!!!!! The biggest PC demo scene archive, and probably
    the biggest demo scene archive of all is shutting down!!!!!! Apparently
    the organisers are all tired or something like that... No doubt there
    will be someone coming along to do something similar, because at the
    moment there isn't any comparable resource for the PC demo scene...</p><p><a href="ftp://ftp.hornet.org/pub/demos/goodbye.txt">ftp://ftp.hornet.org/pub/demos/goodbye.txt</a></p>
