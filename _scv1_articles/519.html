<p>Now this is an interesting story about that "Lewinsky" business!!!!! No, don't
    go to the next story, this really is genuinely interesting!!!! It's also about
    net stocks and shares!!!!! I can see you're falling asleep already, so I'll
    get on with it now!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, if you're investing in stocks and shares, and you want to make some
    money from them, what would you do?!?!?!? Well, according to this article, you
    would slag off Kenneth Starr, the "independent prosecutor" person involved in
    this "Zippergate" business!!!! There appears to be an inverse relationship
    between Starr's credibility, which is apparently going down a bit, and internet
    stocks and shares, which are currently steadily rising a bit!!!!!
  <p>Perhaps if Tony Blair ever gets a bit on the side, it'll help boost the
    Internet industry in the UK!?!??!?!
