title: "Hotwired re-launches yet again!!!"
issue: 8
---
<p>When Wired news re-launched their site (See <a href="4.html#123"> issue 4</a>...) we
    were wondering when Hotwired were going to do the same!!! After all,
    they always used to be relaunching all the time before!!! Well, now
    they finally have done it yet again!!! Unfortunately they dropped Jon
    Katz's regular column (One of the good things about Hotwired!!!) and
    the "Dream Jobs" section. Now all that's left is Wired News, Webmonkey
    (The only good bit left now!!!!) and the really crappy computer art
    section!!! (We do better stuff in our demos, and we don't get arts grants
    for it!!!!!) Just as well the Newstrolls people moved to a new site!!!
