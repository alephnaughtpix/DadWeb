<p>Well, this initially looked like another boring old story of some group
    starting up yet another flippin' commerical music provider site, but
    something caught our eye on this one!!!!! The group are called <b>MediaX</b>,
    the site is <a href="http://www.amuznet.com">http://www.amuznet.com</a> or something, but apparently this is not
    the first time MediaX launched a music website!!!!!!!! They've done
    "celebrity sites", such as <a href="http://www.rodstewartlive.com">http://www.rodstewartlive.com</a> "and others to
    be announced soon"!!!!!!!!!! We can't wait to see what they come up with
    next!!!!!!!!!! Would it be too much to hope that we'll soon be seeing
    <a href="http://www.nik-kershaw-live.com/">http://www.nik-kershaw-live.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.debbie-gibson-live.com/">http://www.debbie-gibson-live.com/</a> ?!?!?!</p>
