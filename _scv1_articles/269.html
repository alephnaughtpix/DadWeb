<p>Well, someone might have found why God "plays dice" (See <a href="7.html#201"> 
    issue 7</a>...) but us mere mortals are now working out how to cheat 
    a little!!!</p><p>There's always been a little problem with making computers smaller and
    smaller- at some point, it's going to be small enough that atoms at the
    quantum level are going to add loadsa errors!!! Well, now some clever people
    have invented ... quantum error correction!!!! So now we'll be able to build
    computers even smaller!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/1998/physnews.388.htm">http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/1998/physnews.388.htm</a></p>
