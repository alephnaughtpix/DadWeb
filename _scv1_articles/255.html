<p>There are quite a few people in my old university who talk using
    lots of words ending in "ism" and say "... , basically, ..." a lot,
    who are going to really like this!!! <b>Protest.net</b> is a site
    which allows anyone with a cause to advertise their protest, demonstrations, boycotts, etc. and
    let everyone see it. I'm sure this site is required viewing M15
    and CIA people!!!! The best bit about it though is that the contact
    email addr is rabble-rouser@protest.net !!!!
