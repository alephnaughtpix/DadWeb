<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could just "make up" a TV
    prog?!?!?! Well, soon, you might be able to find out- and it's partly thanks
    to Carlton, a TV company that's already rather well known for "making up" their
    programs, especially they're current affairs programs about drug barons or
    Fidel Castro!!!! The comnpany is going to be working with Granada and WebTV to
    make interactive telly proggies for us mere mortals in the UK!!!! I wonder what
    the programmes will be like?!?!? Perhaps we'll get an interactive story about
    someone from Conornation Street "making up" a story about Fidel Castro- on the
    web!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.internet-magazine.co.uk/news/nov/18d.htm">http://www.internet-magazine.co.uk/news/nov/18d.htm</a></p>
