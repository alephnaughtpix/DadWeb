<p>Search Engines are really brilliant, aren't they?!?!??! The only problem is that
    there's loads of them, and each of them are good in their own way!!!!! So wouldn't it
    be really great if they were all combined!?!?!? Well, there are a couple of websites
    that do this!!!!!! The best one we've seen around is given the really funky name of
    "<b>DogPile</b>", which is really cool, because it goes around a "pile" of search engines
    like a very eager "dog" to get it's results!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.dogpile.com/">http://www.dogpile.com/</a></p><p>Now there's even personal search engine programs, which also compile results from zillionz
    of searchies!!!!! At this point however, a couple of the "big names" in search engines are
    starting to get a little cheesed off with people using their sites like this, and are attempting
    to find ways to thwart these proggies!!! But it's going to be very hard, I think!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15928.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15928.html</a></p>
