<p>Well, that's what quite a lot of people are already saying on tha NetWeb Usenet
    bbs thingy!!!!!!! But what they might not be aware of is that they're
    unwittingly advertising a new site!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's called (drum roll!!!) ...
    erm, <b>Yahoo Suck!</b>, and it's a web portal.... Erm, a little bit like
    Yahoo!!!!! You might think "What the feck (!!!!!) is the point of
    that?!?!??!?", but apparently this accepts a lot of the sites that Yahoo won't
    or can't accept, because they're too naughty, or they've forgotten about them,
    or can't be bothered, or whatever excuse they give!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p> Well, this one is a little different!!!!!!!!! One of the sections one it's 
    front page is "<b>Internet Sex</b>"!!!!!!!!! What's really funny is 
    that at the time of writing, this heading has a little icon next to 
    it- it's the icon from "Zing!"!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="10.html#312"> 
    issue 10</a>...) We don't know how long this icon is going to last!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Mind you, we don't know how long the entire site is going to last, 
    given that Yahoo has already launched legal action against a "French 
    tobacco" site called <b>Yahooka</b>!!!!!!! But we think this lot are 
    really sound!!!!!!!!!! After all, their site uses <b>MySQL</b>, the 
    same database program we use to make up our issues of Senior Citizen!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    So they must be really intelligent!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.yahoosuck.com/">http://www.yahoosuck.com/</a></p>
