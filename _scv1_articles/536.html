<p>You know that spiffy little object in those "Star Trek" stories called a
    "universal translator", which translates any language into the language you
    hear!?!?!! (Erm, hang on!!! How come it knows what language you speak!??!!?
    And how come you hear the translation from your translator, but not from
    anyone elses?!?!?!? If you ask me, that Bable Fish is a much more sensible
    idea!!!! Erm, where was I!??!?!) Oh yes, they're developing something called
    a "universal computing language", which is like a universal language which,
    erm, works on all computers... So, er, how is this different from Java
    then!??!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29199,00.html?st.ne.lh..ni">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29199,00.html?st.ne.lh..ni</a></p>
