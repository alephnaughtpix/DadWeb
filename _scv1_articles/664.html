<p>Well, none of 
    us smoke or anything, so we don't really need any safety matches!!!!!! 
    Unless of course our electricity gets cut off!!!!! But in future we 
    might be using a matchbox all the time- to serve webpages!!!!!!!!!! 
    That's because the world's smallest webserver hardware has been made, 
    and it's the size of a box of matches!!!!!!!!! Check it out on this 
    webpage, which is served by the same webserver!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://wearables.stanford.edu/">http://wearables.stanford.edu/</a></p>
