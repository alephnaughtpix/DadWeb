<p>But watch out!!!!!!!! If you try and map Double Dragon onto a double-donut,
    the computer might get a bit annoyed!!!! Sounds unlikely?!?!?! Well, not
    according to George B. Dyson, who thinks that computers are already on their
    way to becoming intelligent, and even today they way computers "act" can
    appear to humans as corresponding to "emotions" and "behaviour"!!!!!!</p><p>I know what this guy means!!!!! My computer gets "tired" if I run Windows 95
    on it for too long, and it stops working!!! Then, I have to switch it off, to
    give it a "rest", and then later when I "wake" it up, it's "better" again!!!!</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/98/09/24/0727236.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/98/09/24/0727236.shtml</a></p><p>Hang on, this Slashdot "review" looks a little familiar....</p><p><a href="http://www.forum2.org/tal/books/darwin.html">http://www.forum2.org/tal/books/darwin.html</a></p>
