<p>We've just found one of the best movie internet sites ever!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a site devoted
    to Edward G Wood, director of such classics as "Plan 9 From Outer Space", and that one
    with the plastic surgeon who does operations on a sofa, using such clinical precautions as
    bowls of hot water and towels!!!!!!!! One of the really good bits is a detailed list of
    continuity bloopers for "Plan 9...", so you can shout along with it, like it was the "Rocky
    Horror Picture Show"!!!!!! Except of course that there's no music.</p><p><a href="http://hem2.passagen.se/mwrang/edold.htm">http://hem2.passagen.se/mwrang/edold.htm</a></p>
