<p>Have you ever recently played a game of dominoes, looked at the pieces, and thought: 
    <i>"Wouldn't it be great if I could base a new method of computing on 
    this?!?!?!?!?"</i> Well, if you haven't it's a bit late now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Because someone's already started working on using quantum dots- for 
    quantum computing!!!! Apparently it uses electrons or something.</p><p><a href="http://customnews.cnn.com/cnews/pna.show_story?p_art_id=3372002&amp;p_section_name=Sci-Tech&amp;p_art_type=9540&amp;p_subcat=Nuclear&amp;p_category=Sciences">http://customnews.cnn.com/cnews/pna.show_story?p_art_id=3372002<br/>
