<p>Have you ever seen those crappy romance books by Mills &amp; Boon or Barbra
    Cartland, and thought "Flippin' Eck!!! The way they're churning that old
    tripe out, you'd think they're computers or something!!!!!!" Well, they're
    not!!!!! Because here's a *<b>real</b>* computer romance book writer!!!!
    <b>Personal Passions</b>, some wacky US Internet service thingy, have gone
    one step better than wedding videos, and have invented *<b>personalised
      romance novels</b>*!!! Apparently if you give them some money, they feed
    the details of you and your partner into some computer thingy, which then
    goes away and writes a romance novel!!!!! So now you can give your friends
    something that'll really make them vomit!!!!! (If they ever read it!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.personal-passions.com/">http://www.personal-passions.com/</a></p>
