<p>I saw of mention of <b>Yellow Pages</b> UK site re-design in the very nice
    <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a> with some comment along
    the lines of it being really bad!!!!!! We thought: <i>"It's can't possibly
    be worse than it was before!!!!!"</i> We saw the initial page and it wasn't
    too bad... then we saw the rest of the site, and it was a flippin' bomb-site,
    that looks as though it was designed by a 7 year-old!!!!!!!!</p><p>What are you trying to do, Yell.co.uk!?!?!? Are you trying to get a "Muddy" 
    for your webby-sitey?!?!? (See <a href="5.html#149"> issue 5</a>...)</p><p><a href="http://www.yell.co.uk/">http://www.yell.co.uk/</a></p>
