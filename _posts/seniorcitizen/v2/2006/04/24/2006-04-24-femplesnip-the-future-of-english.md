U-no, some peeps seem to have into their craniums that I talk in a funy dialekt other than English!!!!!! (As opposed to talking <i>dalekts</i> that are other than English- because they're from Skaro!!!!!!) <br/><br/>Look you buffoons!!!!!!!! It's coz my English vocabulabulary is ultradiverse in tha extreme, and you young whippersnappers with your McEnglish are choking on it's superlovely richness!!!! AdditionaIly, I am expanding tha English language like wot Shakespeare dun by making up new wurds for your edification and use!!!!! <br/><br/>So it it warms the heart of my cockles to w3see that folks on tha tradgeek blabsitey <b>Slashdot</b> have formulated a new word for it, and that word is.... <i>(Drum role!!!!!!!!)</i>: <b><a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108002&amp;threshold=1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=126&amp;amp;amp;tid=217&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=98&amp;tid=99&amp;mode=thread&amp;pid=9182242#9182291">Femplesnip</a></b>!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So whenever you blether with the type of accquaintance that makes up words like <i>"foamhole"</i> and <i>"coinage"</i>, you can cry "Femplesnip!!!!!!!!!!" (Although, you should be really shouting "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">Neologism</a>!!!!!!", really.)
