Now, I'm not one of those coves who thinks that lately the United States of America has somehow devolved from Land of the Free into something like the Taliban, only with money instead of braincells!!!! What bunkum and tummyrot!!!! Why, you've probably still got a few years to go before that happens!!!!

So, until they ban smiling, like that Roman Emperor <a href="http://www.roman-emperors.org/justinia.htm">Justinineninen</a>, (Not related to the angry young rappy chappy Eminemenenmineminem of course!!!!!) we can have a good laugh at some herbert called <b>Jerry Falwell</b>, who I gather is a bit of a Reverend in his country!!! Mind you, Robbie Williams is also registered as a Man of God in tha States, it's <a href="http://www.blogcritics.org/archives/2003/05/01/133958.php">not exactly helped</a> his chart career over the 'pond'!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway!!! I understand they do religion a bit differently stateside!!!! Instead of standing in a pulpit going on about how they watched a local football match and how in a funny way it reminded them of Jesus doing something, US preachers celebrate mass by acting like a complete spastic on live television!!!!! Then all the people watching feel sorry for them and send them money, and then the process is repeated until the preachers go bankrupt or get caught with a strumpet!!!!! Which, if you ask me, is much more exciting!!!! If a little expensive!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
This Falwell bloke hasn't had either happen to him though, perhaps because he's really good at saying things that are guaranteed to make peeps say: <i>"Phew, crikey, wot a complete wally!!!!"</i> Previously he'd <a href="http://www.geocities.com/libertarianrev/news.2-11-99.tubbies.html">slammed Tinky-Wink of the Teletubbies</a> (!!!!! I ask you!!!!) for encouraging toddlers to become lesbian witches, then apparently lesbians and lefties <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/falwell.htm">were to blame</a> for jumbo jets flying into New York buildings!!!! Now he's aiming his fire at some dreary band called the <b>Dixie Chicks</b>, who play this type of music I've never understood, called "Country", which apparently evokes an image of America which never really existed, is nostalgic for a time that didn't really happen, and is expressed in terms of a genre of music which isn't really particularly interesting!!!! However, he doesn't like them for entirely different reasons!!!! Nope, he doesn't think they're lesbians!!!! But it would be funny if he did, because the main reason they're famous is that during a concert in London they said they didn't like Bush!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he seems to be in vintage wally mode in <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=529&amp;ncid=529&amp;e=8&amp;u=/ap/20030430/ap_en_ot/falwell_dixie_chicks">making pronouncements</a> on the Chicks treasonous slur against His Holiness, Tha Shrub!!!!! Using the current fave US swearword, he referred to them as <i>"French hens"</i>!!!!! French <b>hens</b>!??!?!?! (Wot, as opposed to a complete and utter US cock?!?!?!) But there's more!!!! <i>"Politics should end at the shore when you leave the country"</i>?!?!?!?! (So when US troops leave their own country and invade another, that's them being <b>apolitical</b>?!?!?) And even better!!!!! <i>"You don't talk about your own country, especially during war"</i> (So wot do you talk about then? Basket-weaving in Bulgaria?!?!?)<br/>
<br/>
Honestly!!!! You'd think Fallwell gets up early in the morning and practises in order to be this silly!!!
