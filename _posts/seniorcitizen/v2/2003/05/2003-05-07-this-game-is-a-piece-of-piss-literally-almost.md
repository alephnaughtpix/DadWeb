U-no, for some extraordinary reason, folks seem to think the entire <i>raison d'etre</i> of this site is that of a urine extraction exercise!!!!! Well, if so, you are talking absolute piffle!!!! If I were to extract urine all the time, my bladder would explode!!!!! Just ask <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/dudes.html#Colostomy_Bag">Colostomy Bag</a></b>!!!!! (!!!) I use the "little boys room" just as much as anyone!!!!! By which I of course mean the toilet for the purposes of urination, not the dressing room of <b><a href="http://www.busteduk.tk/">Busted</a></b>, for an entirely different purpose!!!!! Mind you, having said that, I wouldn't be against the idea of using their dressing room as a urinal, but perhaps we're getting off the beaten track now!!!!!!!<p>But back to tha urine!!!! Which of course I expel, as any healthy man does, through one's joystick into a urinal whilst in the standing position!!!! Now, you might at this point be bawling: <i>"Why are you referring to your male member as a 'joystick', in a not-very-impressive attempt at a double entendre?!?!??!"</i> To which I would say, you're completely wrong, you saps!!!!! Because the use of the word 'joystick' is entirely appropriate for the context of this story- because thanks to some boffins at MIT, in future when you go to the 'bog' for a 'Jimmy Riddle', you too can use your todger as a joystick- literally!!!!!!<p>They call it <b><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~hayes/mas863/urinecontrol.html">You're In Control</a></b>, and subtitle it <b>Urine Control</b>, just in case you didn't get in the first place!!!!!! OK, the joke may be crap, but tha tech isn't!!!!! According to their 'paper' on the subject, they use <i>'a grid of piezoelectric ceramic buzzers mounted to a flexible mylar membrane'</i>, stuck right in the bit wot you pee on!!!! Why?!??! So that one can use their "stream" to control a videogram game displayed on a tellybox above the urinal!!!!!!<p>Of course some of you female girls of the opposite gender might be feeling left out of tha loo(p)!!!!!!(!) Well, don't worry, the female form was fully involved in the testing of this revolutionary piece of hardware, mainly thanks to this handy thing, (!!!) called <b><a href="http://www.p-mate.com/eng/intro.html">P-Mate</a></b>, which allows allows females the considerable innovation of facilitating the process of micturation in a vertical configuration!!!!!! So, ladies, now you too can piss against a wall when you get caught short!!!!!!!
