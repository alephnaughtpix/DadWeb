Hello peeps!!!!! Have you ever coughed some phlegm up, and then wondered what it would be like to swim in it?!?!?!?!? I know I haven't!!!!!!! But this lot have!!!!!!!!! They've stuck some "special ingredient" called <b>Guar</b> (So called presumably because it has the same consistency as fresh birdy-doo-dahs!!!!!!!!) into a University of Minnesota swimming pool to make the water more "gloopy", then <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/living/education/6563399.htm">swam around in it</a> to see what it was like!!!!!!!! Dunno why tho!!!!!!! And they don't know either!!!!! But apparently it's <i>"a lot more fun than casting membranes"</i>!!!!!!!! Which to be honest, might mean the same as <i>"a lot more fun than inserting a cruise missle up one's rectum"</i> as far as I know!!!!!!!!!!!!
