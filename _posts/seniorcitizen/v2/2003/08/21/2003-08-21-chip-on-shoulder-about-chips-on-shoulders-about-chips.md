Now some of you might be dimly aware that with the crap weather and crap diet, all us Scottish folk are supposed to be dropping dead of heart attacks all the time!!!!!! Which is news to me I can tell you!!!!!! If I have dropped dead in the recent past I would certainly know about it!!!!!!!! So it's a nice breath of fresh air to read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4736706,00.html">this article</a> by some bloke, which also scores highly by declaring this previously unsaid truism:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Scotland's stony fields are in fact, particularly suited to growing turnips. People from other countries may wish for a clean tomato salad; dream longingly of freshly-picked mushrooms; yearn for Russian cabbage or sharp green peppers. Nobody in the history of the world has ever, ever thought, "What I really want tonight is a big plate of mashed spew" - which is what turnips taste of. </div> <br/>Give this gentleman a knighthood, I say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
