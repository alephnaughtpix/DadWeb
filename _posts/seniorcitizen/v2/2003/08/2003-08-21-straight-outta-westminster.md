Cripes!!!!!!! When I was a young man I didn't expect to hear of politicians cutting a hit record!!!!!!! But that's mainly because the gramphone didn't exist then!!!!! Which is a shame really, because I would have really liked to hear <i>"The Sir Robert Peel Hot Five Go Beat Crazy!!!!!!"</i> or <i>"Benjamin Disraeli Hangs Loose!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!! But even in tha 60s, when everyone was supposed to be taking off all their clothes and smoking funny cigarettes, you wouldn't have heard of <i>"The Sir Alec Douglas-Hume Jazz Explosion!!!!!"</i> or <i>"Harold Wilson Gets Funky!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!! In fact, the nearest we got was the <b><a href="http://www.donlusher.com/site/pages/heathband.html">Ted Heath Band</a></b>, and that didn't even feature the real Ted Heath, but some bloke with the same name!!!!!! Talk about a swizz!!!!!!!!!!<p>So it's definately a bit of a shock to hear ancient Parliamentarian (By which I mean an old bloke wot was an MP!!!!!!! And not a former member of an influential funk band as you may think!!!!!) <b>Tony Benn</b> is now considered a rappy chappy!!!!!! At least according to this fabby <a href="http://www.cbm-international.co.uk/">webby sitey</a> by <b>CBM International</b>, who are clearly down on their luck since people stopped buying their <b>Amiga</b>s!!!!!!!!! <i>"Tony Benn's Greatest Hits is a compilation album of memorable speeches delivered by one of the greatest orators of our time, set to music composed by a 21st century maestro."</i> says some bloke. But they don't say which one is the bloke formerly known as Anthony Wedgewood-Benn!!!! For all we know, he might be a "21st century maestro", and all those speeches he made were complete and utter crap!!!!!!!!!!<p>So, sort it out el pronto, you buffoons!!!</p></p>
