<div class="quote">Please call Stella.  Ask her to bring these things with her from the store:  Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.</div>Hello peeps!!!! Have you ever wanted to hear the above in an Uzbekistan accent??!?!?! I know I have!!!!! Well now you can thanks to the wonders of tha megamighty super-broadband inpho-pipe webby thingy!!!!!!! Check out this spiffy w3sitey!!!!! It's called the "<a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/"><b>Speech accent archive</b></a>", and it's got the above paragraph in 46 squillion accents!!!!!! (Er, well, actually, it's <b>264</b>, but it seems like more!!!!) There's even an example from <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/english24.html">some bloke from Glasgow, Scotland</a>, which is not too far from Sunny Milton, where I have my domicle!!!!!! (By which I of course mean my house, not an S&amp;M dungeon as you may think!!!!!!) Tho, I'm surprised the young man talks like he comes from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/">River City</a>!!!!! For some extraordinary reason, they've missed out the unique accents of those young ruffians known as "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/chewinthefat/neds/index.shtml">Neds</a>"!!!!!!! However, let Senior Citizen come to the rescue!!!!! Read the following paragraph through your nose in a medium-pitched whine to recreate the authentic Ned accent!!!!!!
