U-no, I've been occasionally gabbing away on the boards!!!!!! By which I of course mean conversing on the internet, not vomiting profusely on stage!!!!! And today I notice there's some discussion about "<a href="http://ilx.wh3rd.net/thread.php?msgid=3779431">Defending the Indefensible: <b>The Beautiful South</b></a>"!!!!!!!! Which refers to the apparently impossible task of saying nice things about the popular music band of that nomenclature, not a strategy to defend The Channels Islands from The Germans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>Ahem, anyway!!!!! Some folks were saying that some "ironic" combo called <b>Black Box Recorder</b> are like <i>"The Beautiful South with cred"</i> Hmmm!!!!! Does that make The BS (!!!!!!) the Black Box Recorder with decent tunes??!?! :) I dunno exactly what's "indefensible" about the South, as opposed to, say, Savage Garden or some other vaguely innoffensive middle of the road popuplar beat combo!!!!! I wouldn't exactly want to buy their albums, but I have to admit, they're a pretty decent singles band!!!!! In fact they're probably one of those band who in future will sell their "Ultimate Greatest Hits!!!!" type album with adverts that go <i>"You may know more of their songs than you think you do!!!!"</i> type voiceovers like they did with Crowded House compils and so on. I mean anyone remember:<ul><li><b>Song For Whoever</b>?!?!<li><b>Old Red Eyes Is Back</b>?!??!?!<li><b>A Little Time</b>!??!?! (Which I think is pretty underrated, you know!!!! Espcially since it inched all the way to the top of the brit hit parade!!!!)<li><b>Rotterdam</b>!??!?!<li><b>Don't Marry Her</b>?!?!?!<li>Even <b>Perfect 10</b> is not too bad either!!!!!!</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>OK, they're not exactly the <b>Jesus and Mary Chain</b>, but their acheivement in the singles department certainly beats that of the <b>Nolan Sisters</b>, and I don't see no Nolan-hataz on tha NetWeb, so "<a href="http://www.musicstack.com/item.cgi?item=8049218">Don't Make Waves</a>" with the South!!!!!!!!</p>
