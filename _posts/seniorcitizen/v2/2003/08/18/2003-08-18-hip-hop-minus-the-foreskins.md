Well, tha megamighty UK rap scene has already brought us the genius of <b><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_state_were_in/2967871.stm">MC</a> <a href="http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/pitman/">Pitman</a></b>, so it's about time the US caught up instead of giving us all the usual angry rappy chappies who go on about going to a club, drinking a lot of expensive alcoholic beverages, smoking a few "Jazz cigarettes", getting in a fight over who is biggest in the trouser department, then copping off with some female of the fairer sex!!!!!!!! Sounds like an average night down my local pub if you ask me!!!!!!!!!<p>Erm, where was I?!??!? Oh yes, the new trend in the US apppears to be: <b>Jewish Hip-hop</b>!!!!!!! Apparently, it's like ordinary hip-hop except it's not anti-semitec!!!!!!! Anyway, here's three new ones from this burgeoning new avenue of musical expression!!!!<ul><li><a href="http://www.50shekel.com/"><b>50 Shekel</b></a>!!!!!!!!<li><a href="http://www.piranha.de/records/english/artists/art_solom.htm"><b>Solomon &amp; Socalled</b></a>!!!!!!!!!!!!<li><a href="http://www.davesfunstuff.com/funnycity/twolivejews.htm"><b>Two Live Jews</b></a>!!!!!!!!!</li></li></li></ul>Actually, I'm not entirely sure, but the last one may be a "joke" act!!!!!!!!!!</p>
