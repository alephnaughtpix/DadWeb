Hello peeps from the city of Dublin!!!!!!!!! In the Republic of Ireland!!!!!!! If you don't know where that is, Old Fart 2 da rescue!!!!! Just take a world map, and search with a suitably ginormus looking glass for the little tiddly spots on the map marked "Great Britain"!!!!!!! The Republic of Ireland's in the little tiddly spot to the left!!!!! Well, the one that's not the Isle of Man!!!!!!!! Anyways, I'm in this jolly little <a href="http://www.globalcafe.ie/">net cafe</a> in Grafton Street, as seen on this <a href="http://www.globalcafe.ie/pages/findus.htm" title="You might notice the webpage is named after the makers of crispy pancakes!!!!">jolly useful map</a>, typing in this crap!!!!!!!<p>Or rather, I would, because I'm now being told to get out because it's late and the owners want to go to bed!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!!!!!<p>Oh well, C U (!!!!) 2morrow!!!!!!!!</p></p>
