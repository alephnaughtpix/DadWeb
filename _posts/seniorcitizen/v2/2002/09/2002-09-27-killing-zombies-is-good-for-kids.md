And we're not talking about viewers of <a href="http://www.hollyoaks.com/" title="Clothes Horse A 'bonks' Clothes Horse B whilst arguing with Clothes Horse C!!!!!!!!!!!"><b>Hollyoaks</b></a> either!!! I am of course talking about videogames on that PlayCubeStationX Ultra, or whatever they call the consoles this week!!!!!! Oh it wasn't like in tha olden days, when you had an ZX 453543452636562 (Model B) playing "Killer Ampersands"!!!! Those games really exercised one's imagination!!!!!!!!!!! Mainly because the actual graphics and sound were complete shit!!!!!!!! Unless of course you were one of those 12 year olds that wrote 'reviews' of games to "<a !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"="" href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/" title="And the Letters page was called 'Zzap Rap!">ZxxzZZzap</a>!!!" (Or "<a href="http://www.mjwilson.demon.co.uk/crash/" title="Wot a strangely appropriate name for a Sinclair Spectrum magazine!!!!!!!!!!!">Crash</a>!!!", or "GOSUB!!!", or whatever games magazines were called back then!!!!) explaining the completely superfluous plot of the game in great detail, then leaving one line to say: "The graphics are brill and the sound is ace. 8/10."!!!!!!!!!

Anyway!!! According to a group of boffins (Or should that be a "boffinete of boffins"?!?!?! Don't ask me, because I don't know!!!! OK, I'll calm down now!!!!!) apparently playing "Zombie Splatter Mayhem" or such like <i>doesn't</i> turn kids into <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1135410" title="'Experts on childhood and adolescence have long recognised the importance of violent fantasy play in overcoming anxieties, processing anger and providing outlets for aggression.' said some bloke.">junior-league fiends</a>!!!!!!!!!!!! Which of course makes perfect sense!!!! I mean, if video games make a kid want to kill someone, what happens when the kid actually attempts it? Does he get out his joypad and try to "special move" his victim to death!??!?!?!?

Somehow I think this is a bit unlikely!!!!
