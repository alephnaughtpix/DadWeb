Now!!! Some of you might dimly remember your fave w3zine (Senior Citizen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) doing a spot of el reportage on tha webby version of a jolly unusual tome named "<b><a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2000_12_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1627893" title="'The pains come at horse and turn one's self at foot'!!!!!!!!!!">English As She Is Spoke</a></b>"!!!! Now of course, that was quite an ancient publication from tha olden days, so no doubt all you young whippersnappers were laughing and saying <i>"Phew crikey Grandad!!!! Weren't old people in the olden days really thickoid?!?!?!?!?!"</i>

Well, laugh no more, because the boot's on the other side of the face now!!!!!!!! A rather smart young chap has decided to test the translations in this book against automatic translations from Altavista's <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/tr" title="Phrase-book-tastic!!!!"><b>Bablefish</b></a> site, and has found out that Bablefish is <a href="http://www.zompist.com/spoke.html" title="'This lake seems me well piscoso. We go to fish stops in amusing them to me them'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">just as bad if not worse</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So Next time you're using tha mighty 'Fish (!!!!), don't forget, as the phrase translated from Portuguese to English goes: <i>"The given horse if does not look at to it for the tooth."</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
