Amazingly enough, those really quick people in the "upmarket presses" have finally come round the startling conclusion that the current UK Home Secretary David Blunkett is about <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=331102" title="'The George Bush of British politics', no less!!!!">as subtle as a rhinoceros horn up the backside</a>!!!!!!

U-no, I don't think people would be so nice to him if he wasn't blind!!!! But seeing as he's all down on all this "political correctness" malarkey, I think it would be interesting if people started making silly faces at him whilst he's speaking, or wearing "Wot a load of cobblers, Blunkett!!!" T-shirts in his presence!!!! And when he finds out wot happened afterwards, we'll see if he "whines" like an "airy-fairy" "bleeding-heart liberal" about people taking unfair advantage of his blindness!!!!!
