A jolly unusual point of view from one fiesty young woman here !!!! <b>Zoe Williams</b> argues that all this arguing about having Iraq potentially having nuclear weapons isn't going to impress a lot of people because during the Cold War, the "Evil Empire" back then (ie The Russians, and not Saudi Arabia as you may think!!!)  had squillions of megatonnes of nukes, on rockets that could actually have a jolly good chance  of <i>hitting us</i>, but that was OK because we had squillions of  of megatonnes of nukes, on rockets that could actually have a jolly good chance of hitting them!!!! They called this little wheeze a <i>"nuclear deterrent"</i>, and apparently a lot of people became comfortable enough with the concept that they are a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,789141,00.html" title="'700mph winds shooting down Vauxhall bridge'?!?!?!?">bit blase about Saddam having them</a>!!!!! Of course this line of argument assumes that the person in charge of the nukes isn't a complete "heid-banger"!!!! But then again, Brezhnev and Reagan managed to cope pretty well with them, didn't they!!!!!!!
