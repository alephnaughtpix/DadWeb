Wow, this is a jolly big surprise!!!! Long-term readers of my luvley organ (Senior Citizen of course!!!!) might dimly remember <b>John MacLeod</b>, that funny little man from the Western Isle wot writes for the Glasgow Herald!!!!! Except now he doesn't!!!!<p>It seems that writing eulogies about the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2000_11_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1444176" title="During a by-election campaign as well!!!!">Renfrew Ferry</a> or writing fumilnations about homosexuals despite having been <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2000_12_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1730972" title="Er, woops!">previously outed in gay magazine</a> are OK, but it's apparently a bit of a no-no to write:<div class="quote">Had the parents of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman kept the Lord's Day, their daughters would still be alive. 

'They would have spent the day at rest or the private and public worship of God, and not been wandering the countryside, prey for whatever evil finally befell them.</div>Or at least it was when the Herald got loads of complaints after it was published, leading the editor to give young MacLeod the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,784267,00.html" title="'Hi John!!!! Your column's got no humanity!!! You're sacked!!!! Bye!!!'">order of the Shanks Pony via telephoney</a>!!!!!

Strangely enough, most of his collegues on the Herald are going all Voltaire on this affair!!!! U-no wot I mean: <i>"I may not agree with wot you say, but I defend my job^H^H^H^H^Hyour right to say it!!!!!!"</i>

Actually the chaps in the Herald and elsewhere have been jolly nice to young MacLeod up until this point. After all, this sprightly 46 year-old has been a <i>"former Young Scottish Journalist of the Year and Regional Columnist of the Year"</i>, (Which to be honest, says a lot about the state of Scottish journalism, youthful or otherwise!!!!!) and the Herald even moved his column to another day <i>"to avoid the perception among fellow hard-line Presbyterians that he was writing on a Sunday"</i>!!!!! Arrrgghh!!!!! Infamy!!!!! Still, perhaps if he did write another completely different column on the Sabbath, he might still be in his job!!!!!

And there are even noises to the effect that he's might re-appear in the increasingly dotty <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/">Scotsman</a>!!!! Right up there next to Bill "Europe = Satan!!!" Jamieson!!!! And Linda "Porn = Child Abuse!!!!" Watson-Browne!!!! And Kate "Politcal Correctness!!!!!" Grant!!!! And Martin "The Scottish Executive are a bunch of big girl's blouses!!!" Clarke!!!! Great, huh!?!?! Well, unless you're a Scotsman reader presumably!!!! Assuming such a creature still exists theze days of course!!!!
