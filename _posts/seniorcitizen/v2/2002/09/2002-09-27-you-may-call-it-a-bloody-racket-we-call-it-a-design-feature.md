This might make <a href="http://www.urban75.com/Punch/clarkson.html" title="Not a fan site, apparently!!!!!">Jeremy Clarkson</a> happy, or all those other funny blokes with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1915000/images/_1918330_quentin_150.jpg" title="And his name is Quentin, for flips sake!!!!">whiny nasal voices</a> that present "<a href="http://www.topgear.beeb.com/" title="Vrooom vroom etc!!!">Top Gear</a>"!!!!! Although I still can't see the point of people going on about "serious" cars and suchlike!!!!!! Or cars that are shaped like a <a href="http://www.9types.com/wwwboard/messages/33741.html" title="Serious pshcycleogical discussion here!!!!">todger</a>!!!!! I mean, I used to drive a car that had a <a href="http://www.edselmotors.com/" title="Hooray for Da Edsel!!!!">radiator resembling a female furry front-bottom</a>, but I didn't go on about it!!!!!! Not that I need to advertise my magnetism to tha laydees anyway, it was pretty obvious, because it was, like, magnestism, really!!!!!

This is a true rebel icon, young man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">The Wild One</a>"!!!!!!!!!!) to the side of the car!!!!!!!!!!!!! No apparently, it's sensor controlled car radio that supplies some <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992812" title="But what if you want to listen to some Shakatak at the same time??!?!?!? Not that most would notice the difference to be honest!!!!!!!!!!!">engine sound effects</a> or some such lark!!!!! The inventors, the wonderfully named <b>Jay</b> and <b>Jason Plugge</b>, say that <i>"we found we could make a Ford Escort sound like a Ferrari"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hmmm!!!!! I wonder if I could get the same technology to make my <a href="http://skoda.rivals.net/" title="Stop laughing at the back there!!!! Volkswagen owns them, so they're a quality car now!!!! Hopefully, BMW will soon buy over the folks that make the Lada as well!!!!!">Skoda</a> sound like a Scud missile?!?!?! That would really put the wind up the promenade next time I go to Margate!!!!!!!!!!!!!
