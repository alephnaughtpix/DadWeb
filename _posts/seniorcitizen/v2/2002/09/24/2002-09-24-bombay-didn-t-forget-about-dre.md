Now this a bit of a turn up for the books!!!!! <b>Dr Dre</b> (Which I used to think was short for "Doctor Doc<i>tore</i>"!!!!! Like he's a rap doctor that tears up things!!!!!!!!! But apparently I wrong!!!!! Apparently he's not really a doctor at all!!!! It's actually an abbreviated version of his real name, <b>Andre</b>!!!! Followed by a slightly less abbreviated version of his real name, Andre!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!?!) Anyway, he was previously in NWA, (Which stands for <b>Niggaz With Attitude</b> and not Norwich Womens Association, which lets face it would be a really silly name for a gansta rap combo, wouldn't it!!!!!!!) and was thus invovled in many of their toe-tapping gramophones such as <i>"F@Â£% Tha Police"</i>, and has since settled into becoming the Tony Visconti of tha hip-hop generation, producing numerous top hit platters by that angry young rappy chappy <b>Eminimienimeineimnem</b>!!!!! And he has some rather stiff views about people who rip off his work on P2P proggies like <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/" title="Wouldn't be too surprised if ther was a P2P prog called 'Plopster' or 'PlopiGator'!!!!!!!!!!!">Gnutella/KaazzazazAAzZA/OpenDonkey/PloppyTrader</a>!!!!!!

So it's a bit of a surprise to see him getting fingered for ripping off someone elses work!!!!! Even more surprising to see it's that stonking <b>Truth Hurts</b> thingy "Addictive", which uses that old tune by Lata Mangeshkar, and then Truth Hurts sings and Rakim raps over it!!!!! In fact, it's actually based on an instrumental track by DJ Quick, so it's not actually a rip-off, but a remake of a rip-off!!!!! Mind you, Dre did work with DJ Quick and Quick gets the producers credit!!!!! It's Lata Mangeshkar (Who's only one of the <a href="http://music.indya.com/biographies/ind/lata_mangeshkar.html" title="Wot, only 50,000 songs in 20 languages?!?!?!?!?">most recorded artists</a> in the history of recorded music!!!!!) that's not too pleased, and her record company in Bombay (Which is only one of the biggest entertainment capitals in the entire flippin' planet!!!!!!!) are wanting to <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457672/20020919/truth_hurts.jhtml?headlines=true" title="'There was a girl on there bellydancing, just like real fly', apparently!!!!!!!!">sue for squillions</a>!!!!!! The bone of contention appears to be that not only was her track ripped off, but Rakim said a <i>naughty word over it</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Argh!!!!!!!!!
