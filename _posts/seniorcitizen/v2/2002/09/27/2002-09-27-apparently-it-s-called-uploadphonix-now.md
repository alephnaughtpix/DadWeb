Now some of you are probably all too aware of this thing that's been happening over the past few years where someone takes a vocal from Crap Pop Group A and sticks it on top of the music from Crap Pop Group B, thus making Crap Pop Gramophone C!!!!! In fact, there's been a jolly nice w3sitey called <a href="http://boomselection.net/" title="Although I notice there's no selections of Basil Brush going 'Boom Boom!!!!!' Talk about disappointing!!!!!!!!!!"><b>Boom Selection</b></a> which has charted (!!!!) the growth of this phenomeneonenomom, culminating in the creditable Sugababes cover of a bootleg, which went all the way to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1956664.stm" title="Of course, the BBC don't mention the original 'Girls On Top' bootleg- well, what do you expect from the entertainment correspondant?!?!? Informed reporting??!?!?!?!">top of the hit parade</a>!!!!!!!!!!

Only problem is what do you call this movement?!?! Most appear to call it "<b>MP3 bootlegs</b>", but other, slightly more fashion-concious folks seem to be desperate to call it somethin a bit more "sexy"!!!! Like, "<b>Bastard Pop</b>" (I can imagine that one being used a lot on <a href="http://www.smtvlive.co.uk/smtv/" title="Just as well Anal C^Â£t are not in the charts, then!!!!!!!!!">SM:TV</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and "<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0034/dark.php" title="This article's so old, it mentions Napster!!!!!!!!"><b>Byterock</b></a>" (I ask you!!!!!!!!!!!), but the latest is... "<b>Uploadphonix</b>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least, so says some dude in <a href="http://www.21cmagazine.com/upload.html" title="' It takes out the top 40 overkill and gives a song an aura again, the bootleg becomes a hard to find, an underground rarity that oscillates between art and kitsch', apparently!!!!!!!!!!">this article with really big words</a>!!!!!!!!!! Only thing, if he's so clever, how come he's only just found out about something that's been going on for flippin' ages??!?!?!?!?
