Now, some of you peeps who are up on the old 'foreign strategic policy trends' malarkey might be aware that one of the major up-and-coming movers and shakers on tha hyperglobalistic world economy front is <b>China</b>!!!!!!!! Steve "<a href="http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html" title="Wow!!! The CEO of the world's top software company dances like your dad!!!!!!!!!!!!!">Wacky!!!</a>" Ballmer's chums in Microsoft certainly think so- they're selling their software there!!!! Strange thing is that they used to be completely down on piracy, but now they're a <a href="http://salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/26/piracy_unlimited/index.html" title="'Steal all the software you want, so long as it's ours'!!!!!!!!!!">little less so</a>- at least in the Far East!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Apparently it's something to do with the main competition to Windows being completely free open source software like <a href="http://www.linuxlookup.com/html/main/iso.html" title="And you can't get much free-er than this!!!!!!!!!!!"><b>Linux</b></a>, so what better way to compete with it than completely free hooky Windows software?!?!?! Except of course, if nobody actually buys a legit copy, then the whole argument falls down!!!! But then again, it's only Windows we're talking about here, for Cliff's sake!!!!!!!!!!
