By Jove!!!!!!! I knew a lot of US peeps are understandably still jumpy after all this terrible business with terrorists and so on, but this is taking caution a tad far!!!!!! Some zero-budget filmaker printed out a whole load of fake money to be used as props in his movie- then he gets arrested for <a href="http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2002-03-07/faultlines.html/1/index.html" title="'You can't have people manufacturing, willy-nilly, the staples of American commerce. The whole system would collapse.'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">forgery</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wot next- someone on a desert island waving a white flag to attract attention, and then getting arrested by tha Fuzz because it's not got the stars and stripes on it?!?!??!
