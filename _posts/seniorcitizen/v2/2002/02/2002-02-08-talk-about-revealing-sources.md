U-no!!! I was reading some story in tha Wooly Brigade's fave papier, <b>Tha Guardian</b>!!!! It was about the usual <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,646929,00.html" title="Shock revelation!!!!! 'Clunky technology and excessively high pricing models are not tolerated', apparently!!!!!">music industry woes</a> re Morpheus/Gnuttella/Limewire/PloppyTrader/Bearshare (Wot?!?!?! Is that a P2P thingy for "blue movies"?!?!?!? I think we should be told!!!!!!) and wasn't too much to write about, to be honest!!!!<p>Except for this!!!!!! The GuardyPeeps put their usual load of "related links" at the end of their story, just like any tired "old media" w3sitey!!!! And look at what they put as the <a href="http://www.warez.com/" title="Not that I'd personally recommend it of course!!!!!!">top link</a>!!!!!!!!! Before the linkos to the <a href="http://www.nationalcrimesquad.police.uk/04_About/main_opening_frame.html" title="Honest, Occifer!!!!">National Crime Sqaud</a>!!!!!!
