Well, congrats are obviously in order to <b>Rhona Martin &amp; co</b>, for winning <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/scotland/newsid_1835000/1835151.stm" title="And they're from Dunlop!!!! In Ayrshire!!!! In Scotland!!! in the UK!!!! In Europe!!! In the world!!!! In the Solar System!!!! etc">the first Brit Gold medal</a> in the Winter Olympics since Tovrill &amp; Dean fell down at the end of their interminable Bolero routine in nineteen-canteen!!!!!!! Wot a shame, it's for flipping <b>Curling</b>, which is exactly like bowling- only in Lapland!!!!!!! Still, it's quite amusing to see an incredibly boring sport which has had loads of TV coverage for squillions of years up my end suddenly <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/funny_old_game/newsid_1833000/1833965.stm" title="'Wots that brush for, Muriel?!?!?' To make it look like something interesting's happening, you dolts!!!!!!!!!">become hip 'n' happening amongst London media types</a>!!!!!!
