Honestly!!!!!!! It's getting a bit hairy at the off-licenses these days!!!!!! Nope!!!! I don't mean they've turned into hippies and started selling Jazz ciggies!!!!!!!!! No, it's the to the millionz of "neds" outside chucking tenners at you and asking for <i>"ah boattle of Buckie, big maahhhn!!!!!!!! etc. etc."</i>!!!!!!! It's getting to the point where I need a tommy gun to get a bottle of gin!!!!!! Hopefully that funny Bush chappie won't subsequently lump me in with that Access Of Evil malarkey!!!!! (Anyway, I always thought Visa were better!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Ahem, anyway!!!!! It could be get worse!!!! The neds could be hanging outside your house instead!!!!!  And it's all thanks to tha NetWeb!!!!!!!!!That's because according to this slightly confusing article, there's a chance that selling stuffs on the w3 might lead to NetWebby Offies selling booze for motorcylce courier delivery- <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/25-2-19102-0-51-46.html" title="It's all to do with a 'changing social milieu', it says here!!!!!">from someone's Sitting Room</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!
