Hey!!!! Here's a breaking news story!!!!! UK Transport Minister Stephen Byers (Wot a great name for a Cash 'n' Carry!!!!!!) has been in a bit a of a row with some people that might have resigned from his office, or he might have sacked!!!!!!! We don't know which!!!!!!!! And top of that he's been in a bit of a spot over problems with the railways, roads, the airports, and, well, basically everything he touches, and some peeps want King Blair to go el-choppo on him!!!!!!!! (By which I of course mean sack him, not... Er, actually I don't really think anyone suspected otherwise!!!!!!!!!! Unless they're really mad!!!!!! Or have similar thoughts about Anne Widdlecome!!!!! But I repeat myself...) But anyway, old Tone's just announced his backing for Byers, so that's OK then, apparently!!!!!!!!

So bloody wot, you might howl!!!!!!!!! But, this is actually a great time for a political experiment!!!!!!!!! When Number 10 backed Byers, they were quoted as saying that they had their "<b><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1839000/1839536.stm" title="Aaaaarrrrrggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">full confidence</a></b>" in him!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yep, that's right, UK political watchers!!!!!!!! The magic phrase  "<b>full confidence</b>" has been invoked!!!!!!! So, according to past form by the UK govt in announcing their "<b>full confidence</b>" for troubled ministers, we can expect Stephen Byers resignation letter within the month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Or can we?!?!? As an experiment, let's observe what happens in the next few weeks, and see if this magic phrase of doom still has it's legendary power!!!!!!!!!
