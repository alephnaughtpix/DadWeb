Blimey!!!! Is it that long since the second day versh 2 of SC that I noted that some 1st generation bloggers were getting <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_03_seniorcitizen_archive.html#784576" title="Does this look familar?!??!?!">a little miffed off</a> as 2nd generation bloggers who used stuff like, erm, <b><a href="http://www.blogger.com/" title="El Bloggoid todo del mundo!!!!!!!!!">Blogger</a></b>!??!?!?!?!? Well, it seems like the mainstream press have <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,50443,00.html" title="'Blah, blah, blah and Blog', indeed!!!!!!!!">finally caught up</a>, like only 17 months afterwards!!!!!!! So, top markxzzx to <b>Wired</b> for  really being on-the-ball and up-to-tha-minute there!!!! Especially as they're being a bit sniffy about a column by John Dvorak of PC World, which basically said the same things about blogs that Wired themselves said about <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_05_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1285737" title="'The window of opportunity for freebooters to loom large has closed', apparently!!!!!">Matt Drudge and online reporting in general</a>!!!!!!!!!!! (Tho to be fair, they do give both "<a href="http://fuckedcompany.com/" title="This site's really great for finding out when you're company's dead, and you've lost your job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">F&amp;%£edcompany</a>" and"<a href="http://www.davezilla.com/fucked/index.html" title="Interesting to how long this one will last!!!!!">F&amp;%3ked Weblog</a>" a mention...)
