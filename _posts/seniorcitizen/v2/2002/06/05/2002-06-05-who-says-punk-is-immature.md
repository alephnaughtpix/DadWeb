Now, the way this Queen's Jubilee malarkey was covered in the mass media, you'd think everyone in the entire British Isles was going <i>"Cor blimey guv, God bless our Queen!!!!!"</i> and had a Union Jack painted on their face!!!!!!!!! Well, I can tell you that's a lot of bunkum and tummyrot!!!!!!! It was just reported like that and then shown across the UK on big telly screens in public squares to an audience of about 4 tourists!!!!!! The main action was down in London where there was a <a href="http://www.ilxor.com/thread.php?msgid=2216087" title="Ozzy Osbourne?!?!??!?!">truly awful pop concert</a> (Which might have been more bearable if Will Young sung his current gramophone recording, "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_2022000/2022338.stm" title="'Come on babay, liight my fiiire!!!!!!!'  'Errr, one would rather not, actually!!!!'">Light My Fire</a>"!!!!) a really snazzy firework display with a few neat tricks borrowed from our continental friends, and a big parade thingy, which apparently drew a crowd of 1 million!!!! Mind you, that could have been the amount of people taking part in the parade!!!!! 

Anyway, it was a bit noticeably quieter up my end, in much the way that a Marcel Marceau performance could be said to be noticeably quieter than an exploding <a href="http://www.home-dome.com/Telescope/Doodlbug.htm" title="Erm, actually, it doesn't look like fly faeces, so I dunno why they called it that!!!!!!!!">Doodlebug</a>!!!!! So, in this end of civilisation, I can imagine this next innovation in popular music culture might catch on- <b><a href="http://www.punkrockbaby.com/" title="Daddy, wot does 'Sex and Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll' mean?!!??!?!">Punk Lullabies For Kids</a></b>!!!!
