<i>(Cliquez pour les photies!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>Bonjour mes enfants!!!!!!!!!!!!! (That means <i>"Hello you young whippersnappers!!!!!!!!!"</i>) I just popped out after writing the above stuffs and decided to see what this Champs Elysees lark is all about!!!!!!! So I jumped on a Metro train!!!! Well, not literally, obviously!!!!!! That would be pretty dim!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I arrived in "L'Etoile", which is this <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/triomphe/arc.jpg">bloody big roundabout</a> with the Arc de Triomphe plonked in the middle of it!!!!! After some lubrication at a nice looking bar, I ventured up the arc thingy staircase- it was free today!!!!! Normally it costs XX FF, which is probably what I would have been saying if I was asked to pay to go up that <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/triomphe/stairs.jpg">bloody great big staircase</a>!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/triomphe/armee.jpg">nice view</a> and all that, but it looked a bit puny next to the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/triomphe/effeil.jpg">Effiel Tower</a>- so I went down <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/an2000.jpg">there</a>!!!!! Unfortunately you have to pay loadsamoney to get in a lift!!!! And there's <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/1stlevel.jpg">loads of people</a> waiting for them!!!!! So, it was up the stairs again!!!!!!!!! Harumph!!!! Paris isn't a city for old folks!!!!! <br/> <br/>Even worse, to get up to the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/1st2top.jpg">top</a>, you have to take a lift anyway, as there isn't any stairs!!!!!!! So I decided to do that another day!!!! And so, after briefly pausing to kick some <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/mime.jpg">crap mime artist</a> up the <i>"derriere"</i>, I left!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Now I'm off to tha pub!!!!!!
