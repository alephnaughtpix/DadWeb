Well, one person that definately is putting of the "never too old to learn" bit is this young codger amusingly called <b>DJ Taylor</b> writing an unintentially hilarious article in today's <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/DJ_Taylor/djtaylor181000.shtml"><b>Independent</b></a>!!!! Apparently, he's a bit flummoxed what with all the new musical genres around these days that weren't around when he were a lad!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">'Jungle and drum 'n' bass I could just about provide a working definition of, but what's speed garage?</div> <br/> <br/>Crikey O'Reilly!!!!!!! <i>Speed</i> Garage?!?!?!?!?! What year is in your neck of the woods!?!?!! 1997?!??!?!?! <br/> <br/>More amusingly is the (positive) description of <b>The Beta Band</b> as sounding <i>"remarkably like nursery rhymes recited above the clash of dustbin lids"</i> <br/> <br/>Bet you can imagine him on tha pirate wireless, eh!!!!! <i>"Yo!!!! DJ Taylor in da house, spinning some Beta Band, Captain Beefhart, and John William's Sky on tha dex of steel!!!! Rewind bo selecta!!!!! etc. Incidentelly, can anyone be so kind as to furnish me with a concise explanation of the mechanics of speed garage please?"</i>!!!!!!
