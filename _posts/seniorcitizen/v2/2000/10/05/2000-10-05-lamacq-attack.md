Trendy BBC Radio 1 indie DJ <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/djs/lamacq.shtml">Steve Lamacq</a></b> might have wrote:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Well it was just another day at the Evening Session studios. After my brilliant show - featuring Bumhole in session - finished I went off to The Arrogant Bastard in Camden to see MFI Kitchen Sluts in concert - they were fantabulouso. They came off stage at 9pm - so I took a Sinclair C6/B Electric Unicycle Zike up the road to the The Westlife &amp; Satan where The James Joyce Brain Tumour Explosion were playing a really low-key gig. They were scorching! I ambled home humming "Grandad" by Clive Dunn and set to work on my 25,000 word Molly Half-Head retrospective. By the time it was finished 34 minutes later it was only 60,001 words long, so I was happy! I set my alarm clock - which plays "System Addict" by Five Star when it goes off - and fell asleep dreaming of Daphne &amp; Celeste. I love my job.</div> <br/> <br/>Well, not really!!!!!! But you can make him say something similar at <a href="http://www.popjustice.com/session/tenyears.htm">this fabby w3site</a>!!!!!!!
