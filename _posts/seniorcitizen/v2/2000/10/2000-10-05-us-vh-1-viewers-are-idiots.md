You might think I'm being a bit strong there!!!!!! But you'll be saying something similar when you read <a href="http://www.billboard.com/daily/2000/1004_04.asp">this story</a> about VH-1's "100 Greatest" dance records!!!!!! Guess wot- Number 1 is flippin' Gloria Gaynor with "I Will Survive"!!!!! Which is more than I would wish on that crappy "record"!!!!!! And number 4- "Vogue" by Madonna!??!?!?!?!? <br/> <br/>What are these people on?!?!?!??!?!
