Have ever been burgled, and then thought: <i>"Hmmm... Wouldn't it be great if I could get on tha NetWeb, and contact the burglars, and get all my stuff back for a nominal fee?!??!?!?"</i> Well, that's what you can now do thanks to a "novel" new w3site called <a href="http://www.theburglar.com/"><b>The Burglar.com</b></a>!!!!! Assuming of course the burglars in question have been considerate enough to leave your compute behind!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>For some extraordinary reason, Police in the UK seem to think it <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13875.html">might be a bit of a dodgy idea</a>!!!!!!!!!
