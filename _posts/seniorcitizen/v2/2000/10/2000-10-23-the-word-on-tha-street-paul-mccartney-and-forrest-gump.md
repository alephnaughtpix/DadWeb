Hello!!!!! Have you ever wanted to know what the "buzz" was on tha sttreet?!?!?!?!?! And I'm not talking about the <a href="http://www.buzztrack.com/">soundtracker</a> here!!!!!!! I'm talking about what's "in" in today's crazy multimedia world!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Well, to be honest I'm not!!!!!!! I'm old enough to see the "big picture" and know that fashion is a load of complete and utter bollox!!!!! It doesn't matter whether you're "hip" or not ATM, because even if it isn't whatever you're doing will be fashionable 10-20 years later and everyone will pretend they always thought it was cool, like a bunch of idiot lemmings!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Fume, fume!!!!! Erm, anyway!!!! Here's another reason to avoid "What's In" lists- Yahoo has just started an online version called <b><a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/">Buzz</a></b>, and at the time of writing amongst the Top of Buzz is such hipsters as Paul McCartney and Forrest Gump!!!!!!!! Even more bizzare- the number 1 of number 1s is:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Derek Jeter - leading the Yankees into the battle of New York.</div> <br/> <br/>?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?
