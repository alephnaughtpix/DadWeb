Hello!!! Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to live in a country where it's always winter, and never Christmas?!?!??! Well, living in Scotland, I've got a good idea of what it's like!!!!!!! OK then, apart from the "never Xmas" bit!!!!! Mind you, given the crap Xmas pressies I usually get, it's a close thing!!!!! Harumph!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!!! Wouldn't it be really great if a big lion could come along and get rid of it?!?!??!?! I am of course not really talking about Scotland here, but <b>Narnia</b>, where that interminable series of CS Lewis books is set!!!!!!!!! Now you can visit it without even having to jump through the back of a wardrobe or something stupid!!!!!!!! Unless of course, the back of the wardrobe has a connection to tha megamighty inphopipeway of tha w3Sphere!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>That's because there's now a <a href="http://www.narnia.com/">spiffy Narnia w3site</a>!!!!!!!! Well, spiffy if you like that sorta thingy anyway!!!!!!!
