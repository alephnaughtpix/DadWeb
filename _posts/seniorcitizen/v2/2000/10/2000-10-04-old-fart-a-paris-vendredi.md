<i>(Cliquez pour les photies!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>There's some dreadfully insipid jazz playing on tha CD-o-gram in the hostel ATM, and it's just putting me in the right mood to tell you about my trip this morning to the modern arrt emporium that is the <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/pompi.jpg">Pompidou Centre</a></b>- given that it was actually open this morning!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, it took bloody ages to queue to get in the front door, and then there was another queue to get a ticket!!!!!!! It was almost as bad as the Louvre!!!!!!!! Only it was much more "postmodern"!!!!!!!!!!! Well, after I finally got a ticket, I travelled up the famous "<a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/escalators.jpg">escalator on the outside</a>" part of the centre until I arrived at the museum of Modern Art- which actually had more than 2 flippin' Picasso paintings in it!!!!!!!!! The squillions of Picasso and Jackson Pollocks were good, but even more interesting was the old Hi-Fis from the 1960s, which are apparently design classics!!!!!!!! Ho ho!!!!! Those art buffs should see my old radiogram then!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>There was also a lot of architectural models of apparently famous buildings, which were most amusing!!!!!!! I'd love to see the faces of the people who use these unsafe looking structures when they fall down to the ground!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Afterwards, I decided to try one of those "waffle" thingies I saw in some of those cafes!!! Very nice- it wasn't potato based, but more like a pancake in a funny shape!!!!! I also had a good laugh when I was sitting outside in the nearby <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/square.jpg">square</a> eating it, and throwing bits to the pidgeons, and misdirecting them all over the place!!!! Well, it <i>was</i> a hoot until a huge cloud of them flew out of nowhere a la <i>"<a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/birds.jpg">The Birds</a>"</i>, divebombing at my waffle!!!!!!! Luckily I jumped out of the way at just the right time, and they all went splat on the ground!!!!! After picking myself off the ground after I feel over in a fit of guffaws, I made my way tha Metro!!!!!<br/> <br/>All this talk of unsafe buildings gave me a mind to try one really unsafe looking building I saw yesterday!!!! <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/defence_arch.jpg">La Defense</a></b> arch!!!!! This time I was able to get on the lift to the top!!!!!<br/> <br/>I must admit my poor heart was given a bit of a jolt on the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/lift.jpg">epic journey</a>!!!!!!! The Effeil Tower lift-to-the-top was pretty unimpressive compared to this!!!!!! One could then get out the top and take a look at Paris!!!! Unfortunately it was just starting to rain and you <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/defence_view.jpg">couldn't see much</a> because it was "dreich" (As we say in <i>"Ecosse"</i>!!!!!!)!!!!! Harumph!!!!!! <br/> <br/>There was an internet machine on the top, but unfortunately (a) it had a French keyboard!!!! (b) it was crap!!!!!! And so I left!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, that's almost it from me from France!!!! See you in the UK tomorow!!!!!!!
