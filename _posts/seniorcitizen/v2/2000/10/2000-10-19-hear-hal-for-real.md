Looks like that <b>2001: A Space Oddessy</b> is turning out to be a bit more accurate than we first thought!!!!!!! For example that bit where that astro dude is disabling HAL, and the supercommputer decided to take 3 million years singing some nursery rhyme!!!!!!! Well, it's based on a <a href="http://www.vortex.com/av#DAISY">real computer from 1963</a>!!!!!! Unfortunately there's no record of whether this compute tried to kill it's boss as well!!!!
