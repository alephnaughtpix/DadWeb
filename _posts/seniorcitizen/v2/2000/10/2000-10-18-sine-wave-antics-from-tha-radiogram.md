I reckon that DJ Taylor should at least be old enough to have heard tha <b>Doctor Who</b> theme tune!!!!!!!! Well, if you're old enough, you might like this little trip down memory lane!!!! Here's a spiffy little article about the <a href="http://www.elidor.freeserve.co.uk/radiophonic.htm"><b>BBC Radiophonics Workshop</b></a>, which used loads of bits of tape and sinewave generators to make TV themes that you could probably knock out on a <a href="http://www.mp3.com/electrix/">Casio VL-Tone</a> these days!!!!!!!!!
