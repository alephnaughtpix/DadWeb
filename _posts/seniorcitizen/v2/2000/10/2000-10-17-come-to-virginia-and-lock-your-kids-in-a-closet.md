You know, I've never been spanked in my life- and it didn't do me any harm!!!!! But on the other hand, you get these oafs who claim they <i>were</i> spanked, and it never did them any harm, then they start foaming at the mouth like raving loonies, demanding their right to whack young kiddies!!!!!!!!! And it's even worse in the US apparently!!!!! Apparently 80-90% of parent spank their kids!!!!!! No wonder S&amp;M's so big over there!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, you'd think that with crime rates in the US getting to really low levels, people wouldn't say really stupid things like <i>"There is a whole generation of young people who are without discipline "</i>!!!!!!!!! But then, this is one of those people who think they are uniquely "religious" when in fact they are uniquely stupid in a way which could not come from anywhere other than the US Bible Belt!!!!!! According to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/national/101600/spanking_parents_wallace.sml">this article</a>, some bloke's idea of the <i>"Biblical Discipline of Children"</i> involves <i>"limited number of wallops with a light paddle on a child's clothed buttocks"</i>!!!!!!!! And it's <i>"not slapping, hitting, beating or punching"</i>!!!!!! Well, that's OK then!!!!! Otherwise I would have thought "Biblical Disciplining" of a child would also include use of a sub-machine gun- but only aimed at the legs of course!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Of course, this person better talk to some US states!!!! In Virginia foster parents apparently <i>can</i> punch their young 'uns!!!!! And lock them in closets!!!!!! In Oklahoma, parents apparently have the right to use "to use paddles and switches to spank their children"!!!! Apparently, this was passed to prevent a repeat of the Columbine High School killings!!!!!!!! Presumably, the kids will just shoot their parents instead!!!!
