Well, after flash being cast as Satan <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_08_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1043526">not so long ago</a>, there of course had to be someone fighting back with religious fervour!!! And that person is of course Mr User Friendly Experience himself, <b>Jakob Neilsen</b>, who thinks overuse of Flash contributes towards bad design and usability!!!!!<br/> <br/>What's amusing tho is that there appears to be a bit of a design flaw in the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">web page itself</a>, which results in the article appearing in black text- on a black background!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Time to sort out your own useability there, I think!!!!!!!
