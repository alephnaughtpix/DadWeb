<i>(Cliquez pour les photies!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>Well, I had a good ol natter with the various folks at the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/hostel/outside.jpg">hostel</a> about the good ol' days last night!!!!!! But today I decided to go and laugh at some dead people!!!!!!!!!! There's this rather large place called the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/perelachiaise/metro.jpg"><b>Pere Lachaise</b></a> cemetary, with loads of them!!!! So wot you might think, but a few of them really got on my wick!!!!! For example, <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/perelachiaise/jim_morrison.jpg">Jim Morisson</a></b>, wot an overrated twat!!!! <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/perelachiaise/graveavenue.jpg">Oscar Wilde</a></b>- not as smart as he thinks he is (or was!!!!)!!!! <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/perelachiaise/biggrave.jpg">Moleiere</a></b>, you may be the French Shakespeare, but you really got up my left nostril!!!!!! I knew you'd rue the day you crossed me!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem anyway!!!!! After that I went to <b>The Louvre</b>. I was advised to enter from the Metro via some <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/mall.jpg">underground shopping mall</a> to avoid massive queues!!!! Which is unfortunate, as it meant I didn't see how <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/pyramid.jpg">bloody big</a> the thing actually was!!!! It's an <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/outside1.jpg">entire</a> flippin' <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/outside2.jpg">royal palace</a> stuffed full of artistic stuffs!!! I took me half an hour to find the flippin' Mona Lisa!!!! Then another half hour to <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/monalisa.jpg">fight my way past the crowds</a> to actually see it!!!!! Then I went along to see the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/venus.jpg">Venus de Milo</a>, and two hours later found myself lost in the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/louvre/painting.jpg">18th Century Dutch paintings</a> section!!!!!<br/> <br/>When I eventually found a way out, I sat down at one of those nice Cafes with a cool beer!!!! Ah, this is the life!!!! Unfortunately, it wasn't the only cold thing- so was the flipping weather!!!!!! I had to fight to keep onto my walking stick in the face of the icy arctic galeforce winds!!!!!!!! (OK, they weren't actually that bad, but you get the idea!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Then I went to the <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/sacrecoeur/sacre.jpg">Sacre Couer</a></b>!!!! Another <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/sacrecoeur/farview.jpg">gigantic hill</a> to climb!!!!!! When I puffed my way to <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/sacrecoeur/topview.jpg">the top</a>, I then found there was actually a small lift up!!!!!!!! Harumph!!!!!!!!!!
