If you want to see a load of really dumb comments about hackers, read this one about the "<a href="http://www.silicon.com/public/door?REQUNIQ=956019205&amp;6004REQEVENT=&amp;REQINT1=37026&amp;REQSTR1=newsnow">Security industry</a>" and their reaction to the news that some hackers are joining together to make their own security company!!!!!! Some dude with the wonderful name of <b>Graham Cluely</b> says:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Who is going to buy software from someone who hides behind a pseudonym like 'Shrieking Radish' or 'Colostomy BagBoy' rather than a real name?</div> <br/> <br/>Well, erm, presumably the same sort of people who would buy software from a man called "Cluely"!?!??!?!?
