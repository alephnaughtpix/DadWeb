I'd better watch out when I'm strutting my funky stuff on tha Derek Dancefloor, in tha Nigel Nightclub!!!!! Because, according to this article there are now "<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/31-10-19100-23-51-52.html">Dance Inspectors</a>" in Scotland!!!!!!!! And they've come up with the completely unexpected conclusion that Scottish men are crap at dancing!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I never!!!!!!!!
