Have you ever watched some presenter on daytime telly and thought: <i>"Hmmm... I like to see that person in their underwear"</i>?!??!?!?!?!? Well, to be honest, I haven't!!!!!!! Because the daytime presenters over here in the UK are not exactly oil paintings!!!!!!!! And anyway, they're all married, so they are of course quite above that kind of thing!!!!! <br/> <br/>So it was quite a shock to see this one on tha tellybox last night!!!!! Ultra-smoothie daytime presenters <b>Richard Madley</b> and <b>Judy Finnigan</b> collected some telly awards for Most Boring Idiots In A Commerical Television Show, or some such lark!!!!!!!!! And then Judy's shirt somehow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_966000/966125.stm">popped off</a> to reveal a rather fetching and tasteful brassiere!!!! Not only was she not aware of the event, but neither was Richard Madley, who interpreted the screams from the crowd as a request to do his legendarily crap "impersonation" of <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/dbg27/"><b>Ali G</b></a>!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>By the time they found out, Richard promised that if they won award next year, "she will show you both of them"!!!!!! She already has, you silly man!!!!!!! And I've had quite enough of them as far as I'm concerned!!!!!!! I had to go and throw up afterwards!!!!!!!!
