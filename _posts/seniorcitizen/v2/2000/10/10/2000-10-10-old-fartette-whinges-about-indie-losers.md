Ahh... Now we need more people like this!!!! Check out this luvley w3site called "<a href="http://www.freakytrigger.com/2000_09_24_hated.html"><b>I Hate Music</b></a>" to see some venerable rants about young whippersnappers by a mature lady who seems not unlike me in terms of "spunky" attitude!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">[Radiohead's "Kid A"] sounds like a crap IDM record, obviously. A really, really, crap one, with electronic tones in every shade of grey and Thom Yorke, Crown Prince Twat of the Royal House of Twat, moaning over the top of it. "Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon" he begins. And today you wake up selling a lemon: congratulations. And, oh of course the band try their hand at free jazz (still the surest sign of wankerdom ever devised - when oh when will bands learn that free jazz is called so because no fucker would buy it).</div>
