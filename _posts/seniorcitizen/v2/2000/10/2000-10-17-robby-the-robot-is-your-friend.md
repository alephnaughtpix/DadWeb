Of course, if any of the above might want to try and "discipline" someone smaller than their own size in future, they might get a bit of a shock when Robby the Robot might puts them over his knee and "lightly" "disciplines" them with a wooden waddle!!!!!<br/> <br/>That's because robot's will be <a href="http://salon.com/tech/books/2000/10/13/pesce/print.html">a kids best friend</a>, according to some dude who's plugging a book or something!!!!!! <br/> <br/><div class="quote">Today, we and our children are amazed by a synthetic creature possessing a dim image of our own consciousness and announcing the advent of a playful world, where the gulf between wish and reality collapses to produce a new kind of creativity.</div> <br/> <br/>And that's just him talking about <b>Furby</b>!!!!!!!!
