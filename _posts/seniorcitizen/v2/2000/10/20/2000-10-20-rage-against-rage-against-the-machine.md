Now <b>Rage Against the Machine</b>- they were a funny band, weren't they!??!?!?! They started of as a kick-bottom rock act with some 12 year-old shouting over it!!!!!!!! Then they went away!!!!!! Then they returned as kick-bottom hip-hop group with guitars, and they still had that 12 year old (Zack Delacrotch or whatever his name is!!!!) shouting over it!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, looks like Zack grown up now, because he's now telling the rest of RATM: <i>"F@Â£% you, I won't do what you tell me!!!!"!!!!!!!</i> And now he's <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=802142458/pagename=/RP/ALLSTAR/article.html/fid=227602">left them</a>!!!!!!!
