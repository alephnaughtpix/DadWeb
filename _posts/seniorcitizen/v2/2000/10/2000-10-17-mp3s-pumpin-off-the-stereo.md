Do you remember the olden days when you used to tape tunes off tha radiogram?!??!?! I know I did!!!!! In fact, I used to edit out the bloody annoying DJs (Like Tiger Tim, Ploppy Phil, etc.) and replace it with my own voice!!!!!!! So you'd get the songs, and then you'd hear me saying: <i>"Well, that was a load of complete shit!!!!! And now here's something even worse!!!!!!"</i> Mind you, it was taped of BBC Radio Cumbria!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, now this lark is back!!!!!!! And now you can get your computer to do it for you with this interesting thingy called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/16/technology/16PATE.html"><b>SongCatcher</b></a>, which looks like a radio versh of those spangly new HD recording videogram machines like <b>TiVo</b> and suchlike!!!!!! This one even promises to sort the broadcast into individual songs, which are recognised using "patented technology" or something!!!!!!!!! Tho it'll need to be good to recognise it with a dunderheid DJ blabbering all over it!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Only prob is- if it's taped off the radio, won't it sound like a load of crap?!??!??!?! And given that most of the music on radio stations these days is a load of complete crap anyway, isn't this a bit of a white lemon?!?!??!?! I'd be more impressed if instead of checking songs, it checked against spoken word stations like BBC Radio 4!!!!!!!! Then I could use it to archive all my episodes of <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/">The Archers</a></b>!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I can imagine a massive demand for something like that!!!!!!!!
