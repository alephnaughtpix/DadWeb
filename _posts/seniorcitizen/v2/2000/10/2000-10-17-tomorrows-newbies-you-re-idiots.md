Why!??!?! Well, apparently according to this article, the next generation of net newbies are not going to know about Usenet, IRC and the like because they're going to use custom-made NetWeb set-top boxes <a href="http://www.writetheweb.com/read.php?item=81">provided by their ISPs</a>, including such friendly faces as AOL/Time-Warner, Microsoft/MSN, and Cybermen/Davros/Daleks!!!!!! And they're most likely to regulate their end of tha NetWeb so their "consumers" aren't too educated enough to get <a href="http://www.infomagic.net/liberty/vs000804.htm">ideas above their station</a>!!!!!!!! So you possibly say that it's a "comprehensive" internet they'll be using, whilst you're reading the "grammar school" versh!!!!!!! (And we're still not talking about old ladies here!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Gaahh!!!! I remember when this Internet was all text fields you know!!!!!!!! Just as well there's memories filled sites like this so young whippersnappers can learn the "big picture" from old codgers like me!!!!!!
