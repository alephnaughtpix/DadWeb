U-no, when I'm surfing tha megamighty NetWeb, I often think: <i>"Hmmm... It's about time I went to a site where I have to download a big Flash jobbie which sucks up all my bandwidth so that it can throw it's counter-intuitive navigation around the screen in hideous animated globules!!!!"</i> <br/> <br/>So it warms my old cockles to read the following in <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/sympathy/article.txt">this article</a>:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Foolish designers! Did you really think your pitiful HTML could stand up to my onslaught? And you- wretched coders, huddling at your desks- did you think I would abide by your specs? Bah! I wipe myself with your white papers.</div> <br/> <br/>Yes, it's <b>Flash</b>- cast as Satan, by some really unimaginative "Flasher"!!!!! (!!! Ooh-er!!!!! Oh crikey Vicar!!!!! etc)
