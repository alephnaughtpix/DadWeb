<i>(Cliquez pour les photies!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>OK, I'm back on now!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, quietly making my excuses and leaving the Effiel Tower, I went along the Seine to the <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/modernart/museum.jpg">Museum of Modern Art</a></b>!!!!! Why, you might be bawling, are you going to see a load of arty-farty shit!!!!!!!! Well, there's some <b>Picasso</b> stuffs there, and he's (or was!!!!) a grumpy old man, just like me!!!!!!!! Unfortunately, there wasn't too much of his stuff!!!!!! Mind you, there was an interesting video projection "installation" with 3 different films of the same play- in French, English and German!!!!!!! The French one was completely different to the other two, but the German version was exactly the same as the English version, but 2 minutes behind!!!!!!!!! If you spoke both English and German, you could guess exactly what the folks in the German versh were about to say!!!!!!! There was also some <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/modernart/dog.jpg">dog</a> hanging around outside the museum for no apparent reason!!!!!<br/> <br/>Disappointed with lack of Picasso, I decided to go to the <b><a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/front.jpg">Pompidou Centre</a></b>, presumably so called because it houses a lot of pompous art "do"s!!!!!!! It looks pretty impressive- like a big shoebox covered with lots of <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/back.jpg">multicoloured pipes</a>!!!!!!! Unfortunately it was shut!!!!!!! Harumph!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I sat down to have a nice beer in a cafe nearby in <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/pompidou/igorstravinsky.jpg"><b>Igor Stravinsky</b> square</a>- named after another grumpy old man like me!!!! I asked for what I thought was a 40cl (<i>"Quarante"!!!!!!</i>) measure of beer- unfortunately I asked for <i>"Quatorze"</i> (14cl in French!!!!!!!), and was most disappointed with the results!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>After talking with some young whippersnappers last night, I was recommended to go to a strange place I would not normally go!!!!! OK, how does this grab you: cheap food, music you can listen to on headphones, leather seats, and you can get a good beer with your meal..... Wot is this place!??!?!? Only flippin' <b>MacDonalds</b> on the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/triomphe/champselesys.jpg">Champs Elysees</a>!!!!! No wonder this "restaurant" is hidden underground in a shopping mall!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Next on my whirlwind tour was <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/notredame/bridgeview.jpg">Notre Dame</a>!!!!!!! Wot a flippin' disappointment!!!!! A <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/notredame/fullwidth.jpg">big church</a>, basically!!!!! I had much more enjoyment afterwards when I was walking along the Seine, waving at the folks in the tourist boats sailing along, then mooning at them when they <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/seine/waving.jpg">waved back</a>!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>After another bit of lubrication at <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/seine/bar.jpg">another cafe</a>, I decided to take a trip to some big place called "<b>La Defence</b>". When I emerged from the Metro there, it was like I had been transported to <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/shopping.jpg">another planet</a>!!!!!!! There were <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/spacedome.jpg">space aged</a> <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/spaceage.jpg">skyscrapers</a> everywhere, and in the middle was a <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/arch2.jpg">massive square arch</a> composed of two tower blocks with another on it's side, plonked on top, connecting the two!!!!!! And there's a <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/defence/lifts_up.jpg">few lifts down to the ground</a> suspended from the top!!!! There's some "Imax" cinema nearby, but apart from that, it was a bloody boring place!!!!!!!! I couldn't even get onto the lift to the top of the arch, as it was shut!!!!!! The only interesting bit was that you could look down the hill and see the Arc de Triomphe!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I went back to the hostel eventually, and found my feet had expanded by 200% in size!!!!!! Eek!!!!!
