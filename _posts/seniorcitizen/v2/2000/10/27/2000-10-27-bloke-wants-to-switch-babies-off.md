There's this bloke in the <b>Glasgow Herald</b>, that writes all manner of whimsical "opinion" articles!!!!!! Usually they're uninteresting fluff!!!!! But this one isn't!!!!!!!! He's wittering on about <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/lamont/archive/27-10-19100-21-20-22.html">mobile phones ringing in churches</a> or some such nonsense!!!!! But then he says:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Another problem of noise intrusion at religious services which is less easy to solve. Babies are louder than mobile phones and cannot be switched off.</div> <br/> <br/>Switching "off" babies?!??!?! <br/> <br/>I hope there aren't any genetic engineers reading this!!!!!!!!!
