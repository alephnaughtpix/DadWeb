I've been seeing lots of politician types mouthing off on tha tellybox about the enviroment, and I've always wondered- why don't they (almost literally) put their money where their mouth is, and harness the vast amount of energy that comes from all the hot air they talk about the subject!??!?!?!? I mean, I'm pretty sure someone could take a few pipes out of the top of the Houses of Parliament and Lords for use in a massive Combined Heating Program scheme to heat the rest of London!!!!! And when Tony Blair's out around the country and making some speech, he could wear a mask which traps his hot air and use it to drive a turbine generator!!!!! This would of course have the additional advantage of obscuring his annoying grin as well!!!!! So everyone's a winner, really!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, it looks like someone has finally taken notice of my simple but practical idea!!!!! Say hello to a car- which <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_988000/988265.stm">runs on air</a>!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Just think!!!!! John "Two Jags" Prescott will be able to drive himself around the country, just by talking a lot- which he does already!!!!!! And the Conservative party would be completely self-sufficient as far as transport costs are concerned!!!!!
