Seems like Scotland's new First Minister <b>Henry McLeish</b> has got off to a cracking start by pissing off the editors of <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/27-10-19100-0-16-37.html">four tabloid newspapers</a>!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Nothing like good publicity, eh!!!!!! And this was certainly nothing like good publicity!!!!!!!!!
