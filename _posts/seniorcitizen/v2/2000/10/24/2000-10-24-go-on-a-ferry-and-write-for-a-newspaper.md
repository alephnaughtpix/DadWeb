Those folks in the dead tree media must be getting really desperate!!!!!! Especially now they're got competition from the likes of me!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I mean, check this one out!!!!!! <b>John MacLeod</b>, the funny little man from the Western Isles who writes for <b>The Glasgow Herald</b>, has had a reputation of fulminating over some such subject or another in the past!!!!! But he's been rather quiet of late!!!!!! And wot does he write about today?!??!?!?!? <i>"I decide to seize advantage of a rare Glasgow sojourn and visit an old friend."</i> <br/> <br/>Who's he talking about?!?!? Only the flippin <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/macleod/archive/24-10-19100-21-5-4.html"><b>Renfrew Ferry</b></a>!!!!!!!! He goes to the ferry, gets on it, then crosses the river, then gets off!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Like, wow!!!!!!!! Serious competition for all you diary weblogs there!!!!!!!! How can you compete??!?!?!??!?
