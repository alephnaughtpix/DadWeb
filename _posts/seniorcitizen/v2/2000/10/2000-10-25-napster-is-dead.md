Quick, before it's too late!!!!!!!!! Napster is dead!!!!!!! Switch to Gnutella/Freenet/PloppyTrader!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, OK, it's not that bad really, but Napster can't have too long to go!!!!! Because those well know trend-setters <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_24_seniorcitizen_archive.html#928109"><b>Chumbawumba</b></a> are using it!!!!!!!!!! Even worse, they're taking part in one of the more interesting phenonemnomenons happenin' on tha Napster NetWeb- <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_08_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1071851">wacky bootleg remixes</a>!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>According to <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/sections/news/text/newsarticle.asp?afl=">this article</a>, The Chumbies have remixed one of their songs with samples of: (Watch out for a completely not-expected-in-any-way list here!!!!) Metallica, Dr Dre, Eminemenineminem, Lars Ulrich, Noam Chomsky and Jello Biafra!!!!!!<br/> <br/>At least they didn't use Napster to spread the track!!!!!! Rather naively, they're put it on <a href="http://www.chumba.com/">their own website</a>!!!!!! It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts up there!!!!!
