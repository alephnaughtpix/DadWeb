I saw this thingy being launched the other week, but I didn't post a story because I didn't exactly see what the actual point of it was!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And I still don't see exactly wots so spiffy about <b><a href="http://www.groove.net/">Groove</a></b>, even after reading <a href="">this helpful article</a>, which informs me that it's a bit like <b>Lotus Notes</b>, but based on the web rather than a local network!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I suppose that clears all it up!!!!!!!!! (By the way, I'm actually being sarcastic there!!!!!!!!)
