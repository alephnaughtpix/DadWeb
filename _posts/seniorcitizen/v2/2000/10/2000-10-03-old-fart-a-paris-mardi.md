<i>(Cliquez pour les photies!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>Right!!!!!!!! This was a really busy day!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>First of all, I decided to actually go all the way to the top of the <b>Effeil Tower</b> thingy to see if this lark is all that it's cracked up to be!!!!! I originally wanted to walk to it from my <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/hostel/inside.jpg">suloubrious backpackers hostel</a>, but got bored and took the Metro, after seeing too many "<a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/hostel/local.jpg">boucheries</a>" with "cheveaux" in the window!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I am proud to say that despite my age and infirmity, I managed to walk up to the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/1stlevel.jpg">first</a> and second levels using <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/inside.jpg">the stairs</a> in order to save money!!!!!!! I still had to take the lift up to the top tho!!!! So I got up there and <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/seine.jpg">looked out</a>- and it was a <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/palace.jpg">bit boring</a>!!!!!!! The only interesting bit was that someone was flying a <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/effeil/balloon.jpg">hot air balloon</a> over the city for some reason!!!!!!! Unfortunately the guards stopped me before I could shoot at it with my blunderbuss!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Erm... I'm running out of time on tha NetWeb connection!!!!!!!!!! More laters!!!!!!!!
