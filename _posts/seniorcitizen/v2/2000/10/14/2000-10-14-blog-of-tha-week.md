Crikey!!!! The luvley organ wot you are reading was Blogger's <b>Blog of the Week</b>, and I didn't even notice!!!! Here's <a href="http://www.blogger.com/botw.pyra">what they said</a>:<br/> <br/><div class="quote"><b>Senior Citizen!!1</b> <br/> <br/>Any blog that uses the expression "<a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#883700">petit fromage</a>" amuses us here at Blogger HQ, and this week's BoTW, s3N10r c1T1z3N!!1, uses it with enthusiasm. From rants on <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_24_seniorcitizen_archive.html#942396">Oxford students</a> and <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_24_seniorcitizen_archive.html#920148">Gnutella</a>, to posts about a <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#892710">new telescope</a> and an <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#876190">online cheese comparator</a>, this "Old Fart" is a source of interesting links and even more interesting commentary. We're proud to make it our Blog of the Week!!!!!!<br/> <br/>(If you use more !!!!, perhaps you can be BoTW too!!!!!!!!!!!)</div> <br/> <br/>Blimey!!!!! I'm pleased!!!!!
