Hmmm!!!!! We reported on last week's Herald story about new Scottish First Minister <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_22_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1195252">pissing off some tabloid newspapers</a>!!!!!! Well, now the Herald's doing some more on McLeish!!!!! The funny little man from the Western Isles has been taking off time writing about the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_22_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1166245">Renfrew Ferry</a> and suchlike, and <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/macleod/archive/31-10-19100-20-32-50.html">slagged him off</a>!!!!!<br/> <br/>Newspaper politics, eh!!!! Still, it has some interesting stuff about former US president Calvin Coolidge (Who I used to think was some old quiz show host turned fashion guru!!!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"I bet a friend, Mr President, that I could get a dozen words out of you tonight," trilled a lady at dinner. "You lose," said Coolidge. Mrs Coolidge once inquired as to the substance of the minister's sermon. "Sin." "What about sin, Cal?" "Against." Coolidge declined a second term in the White House; his entire withdrawal statement was 10 words - "I do not choose to run for President in 1928."</div> <br/> <br/>Cripes!!!!! A US presedential debate with folks like that would last about 2 mins!!!!!!!!!
