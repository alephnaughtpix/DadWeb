Well, the South of England is now recovering after a rather large showering and some rather stiff wind!!!!! And now here's someone grumbling about the coverage!!!!!!!!! It's David Aaronovitch, the bloke who did that classic Doctor Who episode where the Dalek goes up the stairs!!!!!! In his "amusing" <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/David_Aaronovitch/aaronovitch311000.shtml">article</a>, he says:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">BBC2 has recently been full of excellent programmes warning of global natural disasters that are inevitable. A mega-tsunami, or tidal wave, unleashed when half of Gran Canaria falls into the Atlantic Ocean (as it's going to) will unleash a wave 650 metres high on the east coast of the United States, swamping everything from Walt Disney World to the spire on the Empire State. Meanwhile, heading towards us through the uncharted depths of space, is an asteroid with our name on it. It may come tomorrow, it may arrive in the year 4007, but when it does impact, then it's perpetual winter. Which is a long way from a great fart in a south-coast caravan park.</div> <br/> <br/>?!???!?!?! I don't remember being in any caravan park in the south coast last weekend!!!!!!!!! Are you sure you're not confusing me with someone else, Aaronovitch?!?!?!
