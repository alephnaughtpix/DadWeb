U-no, next time I'm taking a trip up in space, I'll check this w3site out- for the weather!!!!!<br/> <br/>That's because it's a NetWeb site reporting on weather- <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/">in space</a>!!!!!!!! Find out all the latest about avoiding the "Orionids" (Which sounds a bit painful!!!!! I'd recommend plenty of Preparation H, some Ovaltine, and a good night's rest!!!!!!!) and loads of info on "The Extraordinary Geomagnetic Perseid Meteor Shower"!!!!!!! (!!!) <br/> <br/>At the time of writing the Solar Wind is 358.2 km/s, which sounds a bit like Gale Force 34!!!!!!! And there's 113 spots on the surface!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Loads of acne- and it blows about a lot... Sounds like the Sun's a bit of a stroppy teenager, doesn't it!!!!!!!
