<div class="quote">I have on my desk the shoddiest book I've ever seen. No doubt. A leading contender for the title of the laziest, most incompetent, lamest piece of publishing perpetrated on these Isles. With one of the ugliest covers I've ever seen. Generously laced with typos, topped with mistitled chapters because somebody has forgotten to type over the default setting. Paolo Hewitt's bewilderingly titled Alan McGee &amp; The Story Of Creation Records: This Ecstasy Romance Cannot Last is a book with no shame. None whatsoever.</div> <br/> <br/>You know, I get the strange feeling this person here didn't like <a href="http://www.tangents.co.uk/tangents/modern/creation.html">Paolo Hewitt 's new book on the Creation record label</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
