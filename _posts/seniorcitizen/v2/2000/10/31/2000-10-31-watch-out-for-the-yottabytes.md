Nope!!!!!!!!! We're not talking about some distant archeological relative of the trilobytes here!!!!!!!!!! We're of course talking about a measurement of data storage size!!!!!!! If you thought gigabytes and terabytes were a lot of stuffs, then apparently the world produced 2.1 "exabytes", and if you don't understand that you need to read <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/rcfoc/column001030.htm">this spiffy article</a>, which talks about, erm, what a jolly big wad of information we store these days on tha compute!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>BTW I've probably viewed at least a terabyte in web pages alone since I started <b>Senior Citizen</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!
