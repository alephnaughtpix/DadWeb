Well, I bet you'd never thought you'd see the day when mythical fairytale characters appear as spiffy handheld computers!!!!!! Well, to be honest, neither did I!!!!!!! But this lot did!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>At least, they've named their spiffy handheld project "<a href="http://www.isi.edu/teamcore/info.html">Electronic Elves</a>" for some reason!!!!!!!! There's also some unexplained reference to a "Friday People Locator Service" as well!!!! Tho, why, I dunno!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I notice one of their crew is named after that Chandrashekar dude who worked out equations governing the size of the singularity of a black hole!!!! Well, let's hope this project doesn't get sucked into oblivion by an extreme gravational force!!!!!!!!!! That would be really unfortunate!!!!!!!!
