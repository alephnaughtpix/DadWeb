So, after Britain gets stuck after the "wrong" type of weather, maybe it's citizens will be a bit more attuned to the idea of weather modification!!!!!!! However, the number one country in weather modification is none other than <a href="http://www.chinaonline.com/topstories/001027/1/C00101903.asp">China</a>, which many are seeing as the next Cold War villian!!!! (Which is a bit ironic, when you think about it!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Even more ominously, it's expertise is in creating rainclouds!!!!!! Cripes!!!!!! if South East took any more rain, it would sink!!!!!!!!
