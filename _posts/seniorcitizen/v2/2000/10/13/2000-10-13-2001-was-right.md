Remember how everyone laughed at that bit in <a href="http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/2001/index.html"><b>"2001: A Space Oddessy"</b></a> where that bloke goes through some space-time-warp thingymajiggy and sees stuff which is supposed to be "stellar phenomena" but looks suspiciously like slomo film of paint being mixed!??!?!?!??!?!<br/> <br/>Well, you'll laugh on the other side of your face when you see <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/0204/index.html">this piccy taken by a NASA probe</a>, of the inside bits of our galaxy!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>In fact, why not make your own 2001 "trip", by taking a few of those pictures, and showing each for about 30 seconds, accompanied by a Georgi Ligeti/Stockhausen gramophone!!!!! Or even Radiohead's "Kid A", if you're really twisted!!!!!!!!
