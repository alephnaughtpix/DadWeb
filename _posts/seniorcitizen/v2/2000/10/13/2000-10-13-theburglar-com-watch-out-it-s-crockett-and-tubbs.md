Funny- just after we reported on the "novel" concept behind <b><a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_08_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1061702">TheBurglar.com</a></b>, Miami (Vice?!?!?) Cops have come up with a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/wires/wbusiness/20001012/tCB00V0846.html">similar w3site</a>!!!!!!! Only you can't buy the stuff, obviously!!!!!! It would be funny to see if the site plays some Jan Hammer music in MIDI format tho!!!!!!
