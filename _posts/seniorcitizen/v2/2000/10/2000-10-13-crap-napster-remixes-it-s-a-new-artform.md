Well, when I downloaded that obviously home recorded remix of Aqua's "Barbie Girl" <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/6.html#194">all those years ago</a>, what I didn't know was that I was listening to the future of music!!!!!!! Well, at least it is according to this <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0034/dark.shtml">"interesting"  article</a>, which mentions all the "hybrid" remixes which have appeared on Napster, most of which appear to involve Britney Spears and Eminemenimineminem!!!!!! Funnily enough it's all done with the likes of Cooledit by people who call themselves DJs!!!!
