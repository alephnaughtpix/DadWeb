Hello fans!!!!!!!! Have you ever wanted to take a trip to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon?!?!?!? Or trek up to the top of the Tower of Babel!?!?!?! Or even fly around the Colossus of Rhodes?!?!?!? (Although I suspect this Rhodes dude has it pretty puny- compared to <i>my</i> "colossus" anyway!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Well, you might have a slight problem acheiving such a holiday objective, given the current non-existance of the above in any appreciable fashion!!!!! However, thanks to tha w3 inphoway-highpipe you can now solve this somewhat awkward predicament to your mutual advantage without having to entail the significant pecuniary deficit-enchancing scenario of having to manually construct the bloody things yourself!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Say hello to <b><a href="http://www.unmuseum.org/wonders.htm">The Seven Wonders of the World</a></b>- in VR format!!!!!!!! They even chuck in 3 extra "wonders" to make it up to ten!!!! Well, obviously they didn't chuck them in literally!!!!! I mean, if someone literally threw Stonehenge at you, you would have to execute some pretty fancy footwork in order to avoid getting slightly bruised by the imminent landing of a large collection of rather weighty ancient architecture!!!!!!!!
