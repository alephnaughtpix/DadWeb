When you're as ancient as I am, you'll probably know what a long history there is of TV/film merchandising where the "action figures" bear absolutely zero resemblence to the characters they're supposed to represent!!!! For example, the Tom Baker "Doctor Who" figure which looks more like Gareth Hunt of the New Avengers gone to Ascot!!!!!!! Or the recently "re-released" Luke Skywalker, which looked more Conan the Judo Instructor!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So you'll no doubt be glad to know that there's <a href="http://www.aztechtoyz.com/screamers.html">completely unconvincing action figures</a> even for ancient movies such as "<b>Nosferatu</b>", which were made even before there were talkies!!!!!!! The range is called "screamers"- probably named after the reaction of any sensible person when they realise how little resemblence they bear to the movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!
