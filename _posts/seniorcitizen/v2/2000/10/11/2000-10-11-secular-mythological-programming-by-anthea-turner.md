The great thing about tha w3 is that there's always someone on it stating the bleeding obvious!!!!!!!!!! So here's some bloke saying that, believe it or not, <b>"<a href="http://www.notesinbottle.com/virt16.htm">Today's celebrity system represents a potent form of secular mythology</a>."</b>!!!!!!!!! Well, I never!!!!!! Bet this will shock those folks at "<b>Hello!</b>" magazine!!!!!! <br/> <br/>But there's more- he mentions <a href="http://www.notesinbottle.com/virt17.htm">parents putting children into talent agencies</a>, and says:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">What are we left with to explain their willingness to pay thousands of dollars, other than a dream that their children may attain some tiny shred of celebrity i.e., of "being somebody?"</div> <br/> <br/>Wow!!!! That's news to me!!!!! And here's me thinking it was merely because the parents were complete and utter bastards!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>And how about this for an insight: <i>"<a href="http://www.notesinbottle.com/virt18.htm">Maybe we're "programmed" to consider people we watch more important than ourselves.</a>"</i>!!!!!! Which makes much more sense than my theory that people watch celebs on tha telly because their bums are superglued to the sofa!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>No flies on this dude!!!!! I can't wait for his "satire" and "analysis" on the possibility that rain could be a little wet!!!!!!
