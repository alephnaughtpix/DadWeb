Have you ever listened to a beat music recording, then after one listen take out the gramophone and smash it to pieces??!?!?!?!? I know I have!!!!!! But the "high heid yins" of the Recording Industry in the US want to do it too!!!! Even if it's not a <b><a href="http://www.ubl.com/fp2.asp?layout=artist_card&amp;artistid=194837&amp;p_id=P+++396003">Westlife</a></b> record!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Yes, as this article details, the RIAA appear to be moving towards a "pay-per-listen" model for music, and appear to be boldy taking steps to make sure us poor ol' serfs <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/14006.html">can't circumvent it</a>!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Needless to say, they're a bunch of idiots if they think I'm going to give up my turntable or MP3 Wurlitzer just so they can get some extra money of me!!!!!!!! I've already paid for the records you chumps!!!!!! And I'm in the UK anyway, so it's not exactly my duty as a UK citizen to flippin' well support your US economy!!!!!!!!
