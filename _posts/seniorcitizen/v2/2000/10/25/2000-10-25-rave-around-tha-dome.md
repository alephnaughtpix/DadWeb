U-no, I might be going to London in the next couple of weeks!!!!!!! If so, I think I'll pay a visit to that <b>Millenium Dome</b>!!!!!!!!!!! Why!?!?!? Because there's been so many "Dome = shit" stories in the UK media that it can't possibly be that awful!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I mean, look at this story!!!! According to tha <b>Glasgow Herald</b>, when the Dome closes on Dec 31st, the folks are planning to throw a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/25-10-19100-23-35-8.html">rave</a>!!!!!! Mind you, the folks in charge of the Dome are not supposed to be that hip to the beat!!!!! So their idea of a "rave" might involve putting on Pink Floyd!!!!!! Still, it would be most amusing if Craig David come on at the same time, and they did a UK Garage version of "Comfortably Numb"!!!!! Imagine the scene: a nice big chunky beat with Craig David going: <i>"Uh... Craig David... Uh, uh.... Bo Selecta!!!! etc"</i> and David Gilmour widdling away on some guitar solo oddessy, with a slightly pained look on his face!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I'd certainly go down to London for this!!!!!!
