Eeek!!! And I thought the railways in the UK were in a bad state!!!!!!! But check this out!!!!!! The West Coast line in Scotland has been closed down while techhy people <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Transport/2000-10/newrail251000.shtml">do "ultrasound" tests on the track integrity</a>!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But it gets worse!!!!!!! Look at what the "High Heid Yin" from the rail company says:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">I would like to apologise to all rail passengers. It is going to be an extremely difficult week for them. We are now going to have to blitz the network and run it for safety.</div> <br/> <br/><i>Blitz</i> the network?!??!?!?!??!?! What sort of hair-brained wheeze is this?!?!??!! I've been in the wars and I can tell you from experience that having an area blitzed does not neccessarily increase it's safety factor!!!!!!! In fact, it's usually the opposite!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, how are they going to do it??!?!?! Are they going to borrow a couple of stealth bombers from someone?!??!?!?!? Or maybe they've bought their own, which would explain why the rail network's been so underfunded and is falling to bits!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Sort your priorities out, you saps!!!!!!!
