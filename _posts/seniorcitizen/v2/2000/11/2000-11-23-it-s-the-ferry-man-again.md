<div class="quote">Call me daft, but as urban constituencies go there is a bright, open beauty about Glasgow Anniesland.<br/><br/>Seen from Renfrew ferry, it's a rising blend of tenement, tower block, crane and warehouse, soaring and rolling back to the Kilpatrick Hills. Seen from Jordanhill, it's a tapestry of the endeavours of sincere men, through decades, in wisdom and folly, to house the deserving poor.</div><br/><br/>Crikey!!!!! <b>John MacLeod</b>, that funny little man from the Western Isles wot writes for the Glasgow Herald, is asked to do a "perspective" on a by-election, and he has to stick another flipping reference to the <b><a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_22_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1166245">Renfrew Ferry</a></b> he seems to like so much!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>OK, John, since you suggested it, we <b>will</b> call you daft- daft on West Glasgow Clyde-based boyant vehicular crossing transport, that is!!!!!!!
