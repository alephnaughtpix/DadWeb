I bet when you last saw a Vertical Take Off and Landing military aircraft, that you never guessed that it might strike fear into the hearts of your average farmyard fowl!!!!!!!!!!! Well, I know I didn't, anyway!!!!!! But apparently, there is a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/15-11-19100-0-6-5.html">"hen harrier"</a>, according to this story anyway!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Why don't the hens just lay an egg in the engines, I say!!!!!!
