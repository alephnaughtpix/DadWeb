Cripes!!!!! First <b>Wired</b> does an about-turn on the virtues of bringing the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_05_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1285737">NetWeb to tha Masses</a>, now Bill Gates is suddenly having <a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/news/column_dsp.cfm?ItemId=9156">second thoughts</a> about being a globalistic capitalist!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Gates, who has long extolled the power of computers to solve the world's problems, criticized himself for having been "naive--very naive." He has shifted the focus of the $21-billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation from that of donating Information Age technology to meeting the health needs of the poorest, beginning with the widespread distribution of vaccines. <br/> <br/>The New York Times reported that Gates "has lost much of the faith he once had that global capitalism would prove capable of solving the most immediate catastrophes facing the world's poorest people, especially the 40,000 deaths a day from preventable diseases. He added that more philanthropy and more government aid--especially a greater contribution to foreign health programs by American taxpayers--are needed for that." </div> <br/> <br/>Crikey!!!!! And today we've got the US state where Mickey Mouse lives deciding who the next US Prez izz!!!!!<br/> <br/>Has Osama Bin Laden put LSD in the US water supply or something?!?!??!?!
