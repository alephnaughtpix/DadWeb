Here's yet another "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/tw/">Tommorow's World</a>" style story on the latest emerging <a href="http://www.feer.com/_0011_23/p038innov.html">robot technologies</a> in the Far East!!!!!! Apparently Henry Honda (Or Hyndland Honda, as we call him around these parts!!!!!) has made an "advanced mechanical biped"!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Mind you, I don't know about NEC's idea of an "egg-shaped" thingy "which rolls around the house looking for faces it can recognize and talk to"!!!!! Wot if it rolls into the kitchen?!??!?!? Won't someone just pick it up, crack it open, and fry it or something?!??!?!??!?!?!
