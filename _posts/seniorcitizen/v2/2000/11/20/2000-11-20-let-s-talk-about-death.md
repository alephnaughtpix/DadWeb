Tonight, it's the turn of <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/interview_archive/david_renwick.shtml">Victor Meldrew</a></b>, and last week it was ancient tec <b>Inspector Morse</b>!!!!!!!! Now, call me a bit "insensitive", but wasn't that death scene a bit crap?!??!! It looked like something out of a Doctor Who episode!!!!!!!! I hope when Mr Meldrew gets hit by that car tonight he flies over the bonnet a bit more gracefully!!!!!!!!!!!!!
