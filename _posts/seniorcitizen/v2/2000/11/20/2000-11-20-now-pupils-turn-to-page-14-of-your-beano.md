Now this is vaguely interesting!!!!!!! Whilst the Western world is having a bit of a "crush" on Manga/Anime and Pokemon, young people in Japan are getting into a dainty little Scottish-based comic!!!!!!!!!! Yes, it's the <b><a href="http://www.beano.co.uk">Beano</a></b>, the Dundee kiddies comic, which even I subscribed to when I was a young man!!!!!!! And Dennis the Menace is still as fresh-faced as he was all those years ago!!!!!!!! He must be the Cliff Richard of comicbook cartoons!!!!!!!!

Ahem anyway!!!! Young people in Japan are now using this evergreen fountain of kiddie comic youth as an <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/20-11-19100-1-9-56.html">aid to teaching English</a>!!!!!!!! Which might mean a whole new generation of Japanese shouting words like "<b>Crikey!!!!</b>" and "<b>Eeek!!!!</b>"!!!!!!!!!!!!
