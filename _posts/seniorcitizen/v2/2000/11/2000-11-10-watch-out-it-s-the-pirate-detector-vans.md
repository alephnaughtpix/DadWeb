Well, I never!!!! Apparently the BSA, who are very down on software piracy have "pirate detector" vans, which can detect pirate software on PCs!!!!!! And they showed off their "hardware" at no less a place than <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/14562.html"><b>Glasgow Central</b> railway station</a> on Tuesday!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Shame I wasn't there!!!!!! Or else I would have got out my "fib detector" van and scanned them to see what happened!!!!!!!!!!!!!
