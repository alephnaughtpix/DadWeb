There's a by-election in Glasgow Anniesland today!!!!!!! But apparently the election campaign was <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/election99/archive/23-11-19100-0-51-27.html">really boring</a>!!!!!!!!! But that didn't stop reporters getting a little carried away!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">When Brian Wilson chaired Labour's second and final press conference, he talked of how his party's candidates had gone directly to the people, campaigned on the doorsteps and generally put themselves about.<br/><br/>Reporters' pencils snapped in disbelief, and when Mr Wilson proceeded to express regret at the "retreat" into fashionable telephone canvassing, some of us watched anxiously to see if we might be injured by the falling ceiling.</div><br/><br/>Crikey!!!!!! Snapping pencils!!!!! And parnoid visions of unstable architecture!!!!!! And this is just a "boring" by-election!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>These reporters must be really highly strung!!!!!!!! Maybe they should take a mug of Horlicks and have a lie down or something!!!!!!
