Yes, they still have electricity after all those storms last week!!!! Will wonders never cease?!?!??!<br/> <br/>So far, there's been no signs of gales or rain or earthquakes or whatnot, and apparently the weather is going to be decent-ish 2morrow!!!!!!! So it looks like a packed day tomorrow!!!!!! I think I'll go up on that big ferris wheel thingy!!!!!!!!!
