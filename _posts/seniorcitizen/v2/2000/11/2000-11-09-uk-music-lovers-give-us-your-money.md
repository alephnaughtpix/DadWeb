Well, in the UK we might grumble about high CD prices, but apparently according to some survey, we're now more likely to <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39924,00.html">accept paying for downloading music online</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But why bother paying for <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/2000/11/08/sdmi_tests/print.html">new-fangled digimusic</a> when you get really great MP3s like stuff from <a href="http://www.mp3.com/pritstik/"><b>PritStik</b></a> for free?!?!?!?!<br/> <br/>I'm quite happy to say I would never pay for anything from that group!!!!!
