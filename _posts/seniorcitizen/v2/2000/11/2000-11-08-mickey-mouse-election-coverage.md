I never expected to be witnessing a US democracy drama over breakfast!!!! But that's what's happened in this morning in my pad in humble old Glasgow, Scotland watching the US elections!!!! At this point the race is now down to one state- Florida, home of Disneyworld and Mickey Mouse!!!! Either candidate must win to enter the White House!!!!!!  <br/> <br/>When I went into the kitchen to make tea, US TV was saying Bush had won it according to their polls, and declared Bush prez!!!! Apparently Gore had even phoned Bush to offer congrats!!! Which was jolly funny as a few hours ago, the same US pundits were Florida saying was "too close to call", and before that, that Gore had won it!!!! <br/> <br/>Anyway, I make the tea, and come back to find that the vote in Florida is actually "too close to call" after all, and Gore has retracted his congrats!!!! <br/> <br/>Now... If US TV can hoodwink two candidates for one of the most powerful positions in the world into thinking the election is over when it's not, isn't that a little.. well, "off"?!?!?! <br/> <br/>I also heard that in previous elections some voters on the West coast of the US were put off voting just before the polls closed, because exit polls on the East coast and central US had already declared one of the candidates a winner!!!!!! In fact, the whole process of taking electoral "exit" polls, published right after the ballot box has closed, (ie before any of the votes have been counted) as a serious basis for deciding who becomes prez seems a little cranky from my UK viewpoint!!!! What's the flipping point of voting then if the actual counting of the votes is less important than some opinion poll, which, as the ones for Florida show, can be pretty unreliable?!?!? <br/> <br/>Look, you idiots in USTV-land!!!!! Counting votes actually takes some flipping time you know!!!!!! It doesn't matter if it's not quick enough for max "ratings" and ad revenues!!!! That's how elections are decided, not your flipping opinion polls!!!!!! In my humble opinion you lot deserve a good kick in the wotsits for this farcical larking about!!!!!<br/> <br/><i>(NB for non-UK readers: In the UK no "exit" polls are allowed in a general election until all the polls have shut at 10pm... Okay, we have only one timezone and not three like the US, but you get the general idea!!!!! And victory is never declared until enough of the actual results- counted from votes cast- have been declared!!!!)</i>
