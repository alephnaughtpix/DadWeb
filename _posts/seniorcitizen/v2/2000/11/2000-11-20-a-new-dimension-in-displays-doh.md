Next time you happen to chance upon that "<b>Weakest Link</b>" quiz show programme on tha tellybox and shiver as you see the schoolma'am-ish <b>Anne Robinson</b> say <i>"You are the weakest link- goodbye!!!!!!!!!!"</i>, well, perhaps you might want to stop viewing telly altogether!!!!!! In future she might be lunging out of your tellybox- in 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Well, at least she would be if tha tellybox uses this "<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,40264,00.html">volumetric 3D display</a>", anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!

Arg!!!!!!!!! Some things are definately better in 2D!!!!!!!
