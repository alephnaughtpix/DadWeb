I had a great start to this story, but I forgot it!!!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway!!!! Wot is this about, again?!?!?!?! ... Oh yes, memory!!!!!!! You know sometimes you forget some important word at a very important time?!?!?!?! Well, what you might not know is that it has something to do with a rather young baby (or "wean" as we say around my parts!!!!!)!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yes, some scientest bods have found out what causes TOTs, or Tip-Of-Tongue experiences!!!!!!! And the <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/14-11-19100-0-5-3.html">surprising conclusion</a> they came to is that it's all due to, erm, "function of weak memory connections"!!!! And the way to avoid it is to keep the brain fit by doing brainy stuff like crosswords or something!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Eh!?!?!?!?! I could have told you that!!!!!!!!! And this is supposed the result of scientific study is it?!?!?!?!?!?! <br/> <br/>If you ask me, it sounds like they originally came up with a really great and useful conclusion, then they forgot all about it, and came up with this instead!!!!!!!!!!!!
