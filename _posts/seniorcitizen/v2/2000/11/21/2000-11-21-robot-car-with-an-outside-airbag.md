Well, at least <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_967000/967188.stm"><b>Victor Meldrew</b></a> kicked the bucket <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1413466">with a little dignity</a> last night!!!!!! But future generations might find his getting mown down by a car a little implausible!!!!!!!! At least, according to this jolly little article on <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/rcfoc/column001120.htm">automobile vehicular techhy thingies</a>!!!!!!!!!

<div class="quote">SensorCar uses crash sensors to minimize the results of a crash, pre-tightening seat belts just before the impact is felt by the passengers, and even triggering an external airbag that might lessen the blow to a pedestrian!</div>

Only prob with that!!!!! If there's a massive external airbag blowing up around the car to protect pedestrians, it might look to the pedestrian like they're being attacked by one of those <a href="http://www.voicenet.com/~acasas/escape/escape_shock.html">balloon thingies</a> from <b>The Prisoner</b>!!!!!!!! The fright would probably kill them!!!!!!!!!
