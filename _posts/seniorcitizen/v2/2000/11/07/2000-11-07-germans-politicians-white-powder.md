Well, with the possibility that the US is going to elect a former cocaine user as leader of the Free World, at least the folk in the German parliament should rest a bit easier!!!!!! Especially after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/world/europe/newsid_1003000/1003753.stm">traces of cocaine were found in most of their toilets</a>!!!!!!!!!!
