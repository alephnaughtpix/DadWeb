You might have dimly noticed that there's a US presidential election on today!!!!!! In the UK, we certainly have!!!!!! Even in our US-friendly media, there seems to a lot of excitement about todays polls!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>When I was doing my round of newspapers, I noticed the <b>Glasgow Herald</b> gave it a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/7-11-19100-1-1-7.html">front page story</a>, and inside said the result was <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/leader/archive/main.html">really important to UK politics</a>!!!!!!! Then I popped along to <b>The Scotsman</b>, which gave it a <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=TS00181151&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Findex%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=id%3DTS00181151%26d%3DNews%26c%3Dfront%26s%3D1&amp;navlevel2=">front page story</a>, and inside said the result was <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=TS00181044&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Findex%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=id%3DTS00181044%26d%3DNews%26c%3Dfront%26s%3D2&amp;navlevel2=">really important to UK politics</a>!!!!!!! And blow me down if I didn't toddle along to <b>The Independent</b>, (ho ho!!!!) and was most surprised to see they also gave it a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/World/US2000/2000-11/usupdate071100.shtml">front page story</a>, and inside said the result was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Leading_articles/2000-11/leadera071100.shtml">really important to UK politics</a>- <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Donald_Macintyre/macintyre071100.shtml">twice</a>!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>One thing I notice they haven't covered so far is poor old <a href="http://62.116.31.68/"><b>VoteAuction.com</b></a>, which seem to be under constant attack from various public figures who don't quite like their parody of political funding campaigns and appear to be pressurising various ISPs and <a href="http://www.rtmark.com/voteauctionpr.html">even <b>NIC</b></a> into shutting off access to them!!!! Never mind tho- they've still got an IP number, (<a href="http://62.116.31.68/">62.116.31.68</a>) and are getting loadsa people to point their domain names to them!!!!!! So yet again internet censorship gets a kick in the brown eye!!!!! More exampes of that in this <a href="http://ojr.usc.edu/content/print.cfm?print=477">interesting little article</a>!!!!!!
