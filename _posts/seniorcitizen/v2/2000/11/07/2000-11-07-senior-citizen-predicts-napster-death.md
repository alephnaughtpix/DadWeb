Well, I was a bit too busy last week to see that <b>Napster</b> has <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39899,00.html">signed a deal</a> with the ol' Bertelsmen Music Group to go towards a subscription music service!!!! Of course, the <b><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/10/31/159230&amp;mode=thread">Slashdot</a></b> crowd see it as the end of Napster!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Which is jolly strange, as the week before that on SC we were saying pretty much <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_22_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1176001">the same thing</a>!!!!!!!!! Spooky or wot?!?!?!?
