Well, at least in the UK, we've got something to be smug about- the greatest playright of the English language apparently only indulged in waccy baccy!!!!!!!! But for those who were rather suprised by some <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/enjoyment/Theatre/Theatre/2000-11/shake051100.shtml">brainy bods findings</a> that Ol' Shake was on drugs when he wrote that "To be or not to be" doggerel, you might be even more surprised at some of the <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=TS00180957&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Fsearchresults%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=id%3DTS00180957%26d%3DCommentary%26c%3Dcolumnists%26s%3D0%26keyword%3DShakespeare&amp;navlevel2=">articles it has already inspired</a>!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"By yea and nay, thy lum needs sweeping," quoth I. "Who is thy coal-man? Try it with the damper in." <br/> <br/>"Lum me no lums and coal me no coal-man," quoth Shakey, "this hath naught to do with a sea-coal fire. This fragrant smoke is the effluent of my sweet tobacco. I have it from an excellent rogue by the name of Lebanese Red." <br/> <br/>He handed me a pipe and a box of Swan of Avon Vestas. I sat in the fireside, the pipe in my jaw. I lit the lump therein, very like an Oxo cube. And on the instant, through the natural gates and alleys of the body, did I feel an easy mellowness ooze - easy like Sunday morning (must use that). And straight did I fall a-giggling. <br/> <br/>"What manner of shit is this," I asked the bearded, bald-head loon, "that acteth so strange upon the blood?" <br/> <br/>"Such stuff as dreams are made on," quotha. "Now, what seemeth to be the problem, cock?"</div> <br/> <br/>And this is from the flippin' <b>Scotsman</b> of all places!!!!!!
