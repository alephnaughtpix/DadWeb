Well, at least some of us oldies aren't all stick-in-the-muds!!!!!!!!!! According to yet another new survey, the more mature adults are getting steadily cheesed off with being assumptions that they either <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/27-11-19100-23-41-47.html">watch "Songs of Praise", or act like Victor Meldrew</a>!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">A viewer in her 60s said of her movie preferences: "I like a good violent American thriller - the type of thing with Al Pacino." <br/><br/>Another, in his 70s, said: "People our age like the same range of things as anybody else. We don't suddenly find that all we want to watch is Songs of Praise. We like the same things we liked when we were younger. I like The Royle Family and Have I Got News For You, just like my grandson."</div><br/><br/>Oldies watching "Scarface"?!?!?! About flipping time, I say!!!!!!!!
