Looks like <b>David Aaronovitch</b> is apparently not responsible for "Remembrance of the Daleks" at all!!!!!! Looks like I got the wrong Aaronovitch!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, the non-Dalek Aaronovitch hasn't got too much to write about these days!!!!!! He's still <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/David_Aaronovitch/aaronovitch071100.shtml">banging on</a> about coverage of the recent storms!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">[...] hyperbole and absurd exaggeration now paint us, not as a place of civilised contention, but as a "banana republic" or a "Third-World country". Such is the competitive ratcheting upwards of the description of the scale of Britain's disaster that one more event will have us "returning to the Stone Age", or even the Cretaceous period.</div> <br/> <br/>Fair enough, Dave, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider calming down a little yourself!!!!!!!
