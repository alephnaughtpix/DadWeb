Next you see the <b>Teletubbies</b>, instead of saying "Eh-oh!" (Which no doubt, Americans will mis-hear as <i>"Bite my ass, motherf@Â£%er!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!) they'll say "Brrrrr!!!!!!!"!!!!!!! That's because the temperature in Teletubby-land will be minus 40!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yep!!!!!! Apparently Les Tubs (!!!!!) are getting <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/DJ_Taylor/taylor151100.shtml">imported to Russia</a>!!!!!!!!!! According to this article, Russians are really into UK, having been brought up on such luminaries as "Mr Pooter", and Melvyn Bragg!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Just as well the Russians don't get "The South Bank" show over there!!!!! They'd all end up speaking English like him!!!!!!!!! Which would have been a real disaster!!!!!!! I mean, imagine it- a whole nation who speak like they've got a huge bogey up either nostril!!!!!!!!!!!!
