There's all these tellybox channels around now devoted to just one subject!!!!!!!!!!! You've got Sci-Fi, shopping, knitting, and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sad git with a camcorder showing us his toenail collection!!!!!!!!! And most of them are flipping on all the time!!!!!!!!! How can they fill all that time!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, now we have the answer for one channel anyway!!!!!!!!!! Obviously giving us all the global weather reports didn't fill all the "airtime" needed at the <b>Weather Channel</b>, so they've deiced to fill the space- with space!!!!! Well, almost!!!!! They're now doing weather reports- for <a href="http://www.weather.com/energizer/mars2.html"><b>Mars</b></a>!!!!!!!!!!!!
