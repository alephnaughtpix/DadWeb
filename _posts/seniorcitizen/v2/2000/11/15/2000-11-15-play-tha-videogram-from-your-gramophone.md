U-no, unlike some young whippersnappers I still have a vinyl gramophone!!!!!!!! But what I did not know is that you can use it for video!!!!!!!!!! Well, OK, I did really, actually!!!!!! I mean, being Scottish, I know a little about <b>John Logie Baird</b> (Who is not related to Yogie Bear, as you might think!!!!!!) inventing a video recording system based on this very principle!!!!!!!!! So in fact, I'm talking complete and utter rubbish!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Errrr, where was I?!?!?!? Oh yes, some folks called <a href="http://www.vinylvideo.com/"><b>Vinyl Video</b></a> have ripped Logie Baird's idea off- in a very nice way of course!!!!!!
