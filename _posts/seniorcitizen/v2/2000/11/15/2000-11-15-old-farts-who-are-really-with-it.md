Now this is a real good piece of news!!!!!!! <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Miles_Kington/2000-11/kington151100.shtml">Late Learning Centres</a> for the more mature person such as myself!!!!!!!!! And what do they learn there?!?!?!?!? What young people get up to so they can sppok them out!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Len Rodkin waves a handful of books at me with titles such as "Bluff Your Way in Hip-Hop", "A Short Cut to Techno" and "Ibiza Made Easy" plus one that I swear was called "It's Never Too Late to Take Up Drugs", though I may have misread it. But isn't it unsettling for young people to find that their elders are taking an interest in their culture, and understanding it as well? <br/> <br/>Len Rodkin grins. <br/> <br/>"Hugely," he says.</div> <br/> <br/>Who knows!!!!!! Some of the oldies entioned in this article may end as culturally enriched as me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
