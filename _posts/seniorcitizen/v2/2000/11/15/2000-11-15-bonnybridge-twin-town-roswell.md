Well, it had to happen!!!!!! <b>Bonnybridge</b> in Scotland is apparently a "hotspot" for UFO sightings!!!!! So, one tourist-savvy town councillor has gone right ahead and suggested that they become <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/15-11-19100-23-47-0.html">"twin town" of Roswell</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>(BTW As this is a UK newspaper article, expect the usual "jokey" puns on Star Trek and the X-Files by bored hacks!!!!!!!)
