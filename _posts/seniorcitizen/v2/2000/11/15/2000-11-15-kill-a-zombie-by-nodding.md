Oi!!!!! You!!!!!!!!! Stop playing about with your joystick, and pay attention!!!!!!!!! By which I of course mean your games controller as used in consoles or computer games, not some other thing!!!!!!!!! Mind you, I wouldn't want you to do that either!!!!!!!! I mean, this is supposed stimulation for the intellect, not the other part of the boddy!!!!!! If that were the case, I'd advise you to keep away from the Stephen Hawking books!!!!!!! You might go blind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!!!!! Here's an article about a <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/Textonly/0,78,0-5009,00.html?st.gc.gn..pfv">"head movement" detector</a>, from the really imaginatively named "Cybernet Systems", which can be used as a games controller!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Just don't try playing "Daley Thomson's Decathalon" with it tho!!!!!!!!! You might end up with brain damage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
