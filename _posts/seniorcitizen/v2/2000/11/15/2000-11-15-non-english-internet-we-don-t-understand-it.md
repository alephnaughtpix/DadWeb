So much for brainboxes on tha NetWeb!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Loadsa people on this side of the the globe are kicking up a fuss about the possibility of non-English characters being used on netty protocols like <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/wire/2000/11/14/non_english_internet/print.html">domain names and suchlike</a>!!!!!! Apparently this is a prob because, erm, the whole internet's based on the English language and it's really had to change!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Erm, if it's so inflexible, perhaps it would be a good idea to flippin' well fix it then?!?!?!?!!
