One of the nice things if you're an <a href="http://www.mp3.com/electrix">artist</a> at <b>mp3.com</b> is that you get fan mail!!!!!!! And unless you're <a href="">really bad</a>, it's mostly positive!!!!!!!! However, one artist got this, erm, rather interesting email!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="usenet">From: <xxxx@hotmail.com> <br/>To: xxxxxx <xxxxx@xxxxxx.co.uk> <br/>Sent: Tuesday, November 14, 2000 10:07 PM<br/>Subject: A fan has sent you an email<br/> <br/>Enter your message to the artist here.<br/> <br/>I want find the EUROPE band, for mp3 donlwod. I waith from your som<br/>indication "EUROPE" and  how I can downloud "the final condaunt"?</xxxxx@xxxxxx.co.uk></xxxx@hotmail.com></div> <br/> <br/>As the artist said to me: <i>"Do I look like a f@Â£&amp;ing expert on 80s MOR?"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
