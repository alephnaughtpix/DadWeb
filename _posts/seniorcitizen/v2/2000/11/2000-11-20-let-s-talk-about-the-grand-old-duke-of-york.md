Looks like the <b>Glasgow Herald</b>'s getting a bit "lairy" about the current US election kerfuffle, to the point of increasingly obsfucatory journalistic practices in it's Editorial Leader column- mainly concerning a flippin <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/leader/archive/20-11-19100-22-18-10.html">nursey rhyme</a>!!!!!!!!!!!

<div class="quote">The road to the White House is rapidly coming to resemble the Grand Old Duke of York's preposterous nursery odyssey.</div>

Dunno about you, but I think that the aforementioned nobleman would be assured of completing said preposterous nursery odyssey numerous times in rapid succession as the scribes of this venerable ancient Scottish broadsheet publication push their loquacity to excessive extremes in order to complete the task of rendering any opinions expressed flipping well unreadable!!!!!!!!!!!!
