U-no, it's a bit of a bummer when you're speaking to a conference and telling them that the world only has a few years to save itself from the Unix Year 2038 Bug, and everyone congratulates you on your foresight, then you go outside, and suddenly a big asteroid hits Earth, extinguishing all life on it!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, you have one less worry now!!!!! Apparently that big rock which supposedly had a 1-in-500 chance of zapping the ol' globe in 2030 <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns9999130">isn't actually going to hit us after all</a>!!!!! <br/> <br/>So I'll have some extra time to do the gardening then!!!!!!!!!
