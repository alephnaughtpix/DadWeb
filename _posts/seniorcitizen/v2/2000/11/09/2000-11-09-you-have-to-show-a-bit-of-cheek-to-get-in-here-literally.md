If you're going to nightclubs in Holland, watch out!!!!!! You might get the bouncers saying: <i>"I can't let you in mate, I don't like your face!!!!!!!"</i> Well, maybe not- but this new computer <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39812,00.html">face-scanning system</a> newly installed in 15 Dutch clubs will!!!!!!! This new system is meant to keep out "troublemakers" and drug dealers!!!!! Only prob tho- what if the drug dealers make enough money to get themselves some plastic surgery?!?!?!?!??!?!
