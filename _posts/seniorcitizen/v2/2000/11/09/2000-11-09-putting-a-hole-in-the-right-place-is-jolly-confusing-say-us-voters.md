What with this continuing kerfuffle over who's going to be the next US Prez, which has the possibility to get <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/LAW/11/columns/cossack.election.11.06/">even more confusing</a>, it's good to see that not all the problems with the US elections have been due to legal and constitutional problems!!!!!! Apparently some voters in Florida just found the voting form <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/elections/palmbeachballot.htm">frightfully confusing</a> and voted for the wrong person!!!!!!!!!
