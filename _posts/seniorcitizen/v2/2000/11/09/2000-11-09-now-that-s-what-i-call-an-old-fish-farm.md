Well, coming from Scotland, of course I know a little about fish farms!!!!!! But apparently the Bolovians are really old hands at it!!!!!! Archaeologists have found a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/dailynews/news.jsp?id=ns9999151">massive 300 year old fish farm</a> there!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Apparently, the area is also good for edible snails, so maybe there was a lot of French folks around there at the time as well!!!!!!!!
