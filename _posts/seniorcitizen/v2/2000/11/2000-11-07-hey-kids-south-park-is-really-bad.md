Don't you just love it when an expensive survey comes up with completely unexpected conclusion!!!!!! Get this- apparently someone thinks South Park is setting a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/7-11-19100-0-41-0.html">really bad example for kids</a>!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Well, you might think, why the four fruit marmalade are kids watching an adult programmme like South Park anyway, but strangely enough this survey didn't really bother asking that one!!!! <br/> <br/>There's also apparently an <i>"increased confidence in challenging authority"</i> from kids these days as well!!!!!! Er, small point, but given that generally young folk are more likely to have an eye kept on their actions these days, wouldn't you expect that!??!?!?!!?! There's more authority from you lot for them to challenge, and given that you're watching them more, you're more likely to see when they're challenging it!!!!! <br/> <br/>So the obvious answer appears to be: stop being so flipping "down" on the kids you idiots!!!!!!
