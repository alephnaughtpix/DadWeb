Right!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm really annoyed!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The little internet compute in the Youth Hostel that I was typing my stuff on last night ran out of credits about 30 seconds after I posted my evening doodlings to Blogger, and about 5 seconds before Blogger received my evening doodlings!!!!! So I have to type them all over again!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!!! I'm now typing this stuffs the following morning from some internet cafe down the road because <br/><ol type="a"> <br/><li>It's cheaper!!!!!!<br/><li>It's reliable!!!!!<br/></li></li></ol> <br/> <br/>All I can say is thank goodness that idiot who disrupted the sleep of nearly everyone else in the room the night before last with his authentic snoring impression of a broken down lawnmover wasn't there last night!!!!! Otherwise I might really been in a truly foul mood today!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway let's go back in time... <i>(Mysterious "going back in time" type incidental music please, Bob!!!!!)</i> <br/> <br/>So, back to tha Dome!!!!!!!!!! While I was waiting until the Blackadder film showing, I went a couple of other zones!!! The "<b>Self-portait</b>" started off a bit primary school stylee with a montage of various pictures and written comments from various random peeps about why such a particular image represented Britain!!!!! There was a lot of the usual suspects (eg The Beano, Dad's Army, Morcame &amp; Wise, etc.) along with the really bizzare!!!!!!! For example, someone had a picture of a loo brush, and said they picked it because Britain is a "toilet"!!!!!! Well, OK, I just made that one up, but some of the other ones were just as strange!!!! Anyway, we ended up in this big hall with loads of big placards telling us how bloody brilliant Britain is etc., and some bizzare sculptures in the center of the room with some slightly less flattering images!!! <br/> <br/>If there's been any problem I've got with the dome, it's the slightly propagandist angle of a lot of the exhibits!!!!!! It's like they're saying <i>"Don't worry about the economy, Britains a really great place, and all the big corporations are going to take care of everything!!!!! Oh and by the way you'll need to be able to learn loadsa new skills or else we won't be able to chuck you between loads of 'flexible' jobs!!!!!!!"</i> <br/> <br/>Anyway, I then went to the <b>Play</b> zone- and it was filled with loads of strange "toys" that to be honest, I wouldn't exactly want to pay money for!!!!!! There were quite interesting tho, especially the "Sofavision" one, which entailed sitting down on a sofa in front of a camera, whilst someone else sat on a similarly accoutred sofa in the other end of the room, and the images of the two sofa with folks on them were superimposed and broadcast on a tellyscreen in front of each sofa!!!!!!! So people on either sofa could see each other!!!! This effect was usually used by kids to do stuff like pretend fights or sticking the finger "up" the nostril of the person on the other sofa!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, time for the film!!!!!!!!!! <b>Blackadder Goes Back and Forth</b> wasn't too bad- not too many attempts at reworking old ground!!!!! Tho again, I didn't notice a slightly "patriotic" and "educational" tone to it!!!!!! This film was shown on a big cinema screen at some place outside the dome called <b>Skyscape</b>!!!!!!! Talk about a stupid name!!!!!! Skyscape?!?!??!?! "Landscape" or "seascape" maybe, but "skyscape" sounds like two mixed metaphors getting mixed up!!!!!! It's like calling a radio "televisual"!!!!!!!!! Mind you, it was hosted by <b>Sky</b> telly, so we're not talking about the brightest sparks on the block here!!!!!!! For example, their attempts at audience participation before the film were pretty pitiful!!!!!!! Some people pretending to be "alternative" comedians pretending to be ticket inpsectors or builders or scientests started to harrass random members of the audience in the name of "alternative" comedy!!!!!! Tho they got a bit quieter when I quietly told the ticket inspectors exactly where I proposed to insert their torches if they messed with me!!!!!!!! During this episode, some interminable video of various people dancing like lunatics in what one presumed to be a "comedy" fashion on the screen- presumably the thinking here is that if one can't tell a complete joke, then one can just act like a complete joke, and that's comedy!!!!!!! In which case, Sky must be the funniest television channel in television history!!!!!!!!! There was a big plug for Sky telly as well of course, and some corny "message" promo film for "Reach for Sky"- Sky's sponsored "Hey Kids!!! Get up and do something with your life!!!" type scheme!!!!!!! Unfortunately a lot of people thought it was a comedy sketch and started laughing at the really crappy script and "Grange Hill" style acting!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, that was the Dome- it's wasn't too bad!!!! If they made the tone of the exhibits a little less sniffy and the price a lot cheaper (£20?!??!?!?!?!) then it could have been a great success!!!!!<br/> <br/>So back to the <b>London Eye</b> in time for 4:30!!!!! Actually, the sun was setting at time, and giving a most interesting view!!!! The Eye doesn't actually go round at full pelt like a ferris wheel!!!!! It actually goes around very slowly and unless you look at the wheel, you barely notice you're moving- there's just a very slow change in perspective as you go up very slowly, then go down very slowly!!!!! Actually the view as we reached the top was jolly nice!!!!! On this night of course, there was load of people letting of fireworks, so wherever you looked, there was the occasional little burst of fireworks on the horizon!!!!!!! While one of these was going on, I asked some bloke to take a picture of me pretending to sneeze with a fireworks display in the background, so it would look like I was sneezing fireworks!!!!!! Unfortunately as soon as I posed for the camera, the display stopped!!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Talking of fireworks, at the time I was writing the original versh of this last night some folks in the park outside decided to let of zillions of fireworks!!!! They were most spectacular- much better than the droning pub band who were playing some "open air" concert not so far away!!!!! There were a lot of racuous ladies from Spain who were also watching the display from their window in the other end of the hostel courtyard!!!!!! However as soon as I stepped out to watch it, I noticed a number of wolf whistles coming in my direction!!!!!! It's good to see the more mature man is still appreciated by some!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, enough craptalk for now- I'm off to see some more sights before I get on tha bus to Glasgow later tonight!!!!!!
