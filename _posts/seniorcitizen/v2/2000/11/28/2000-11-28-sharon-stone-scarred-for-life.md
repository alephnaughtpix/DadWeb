Here's one "Scarface" that's generating heaps of interest: the one on <a href="http://www.sharonstonesscar.com/"><b>Sharon Stone</b>'s neck</a>!!!!!!! Never mind the face on Mars, some peeps are constructing conspiracy theories around a strange mark on some movie star who's more known for a certain other part of her anatomy!!!!!! Mind you, having seen that "Basic Instinct" on tha tellybox the other day, I can inform you that it's nothing to write home about.
