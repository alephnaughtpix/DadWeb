Reporting on this story is apparently a little muted!!!!!!!!! There's a bit of a major stushie between the bods wot make the top level domain names, ICANN, and ... well, everyone else!!!!!!! In fact, there's even talk of outside agencies <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/14999.html">using their own root servers</a>!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>There's some <a href="http://www.tbtf.com/roving_reporter/index.html">other bloke</a> reporting on the story here, but he uses funny words, and I don't understand them!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!
