Well, you might have heard of the Antartic Ozone Hole, but here's a new one!!!!!!! Watch out for the Mediterranean Methane Bubbles!!!!!! Apparetnly there's a lot of "gas" lying around on the floor of the Mediterranean, and global warming could be causing it to rise!!!! The bubbles could even cuase ships to sink, turning the area into <i>"<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/2-11-19100-23-42-32.html">a kind of Greek Bermuda triangle</a>"</i>!!!!!!! Oddly enough, methane bubbles has actually been suggested as a way of explaing the Bermuda Triangle as well...<br/> <br/>Death by gassy farts from the bowels of the planet!??!?!?!? Sounds a bit nasty to me!!!!!!!!
