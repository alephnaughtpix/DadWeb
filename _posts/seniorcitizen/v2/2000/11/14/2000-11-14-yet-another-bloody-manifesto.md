Honestly!!!!!!!!! As soon anyone gets an idea these days, they brand it, put it on tha NetWeb, and call it a flippin' "manifesto"!!!!!!!!!! I wouldn't be surprised if we get a "Ploppy Manifesto" the way things are going!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Ahem anyway!!!!! The latest "manifesto" is actually an interesting one- the "Celestial Jukebox"!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Nope!!!!!!!! We're not talking about a supernatural afterlife musicians repository combo, featuring the likes of Hendrix and Cobain, you know, jamming and stuff!!!!!!!!! In fact it's a summary of one possible method of <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/11/13/jukebox/print.html">digital music distribution</a>!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Only prob- if it's got a "manifesto", how would you vote for a "celestial jukebox"?!?!??! I think even with the big hoo-hah over the US elections ATM, Bush and Gore might pay attention enough to say there might be a bit of a difficulty in allowing a nebulous concept of digital distribution for commercial musicians to gain political power!!!!!!! I mean, wouldn't it make the ballot papers even more confusing?!?!?!?!?!
