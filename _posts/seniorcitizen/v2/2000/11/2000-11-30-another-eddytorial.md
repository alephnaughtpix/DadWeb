Cough!!! Cough!!!! Sniffle!!!! etc. Yes, I've still got the cold!!!!! In fact, I was in bed yesterday!!!!!!!! But I managed to drag myself out for long enough to finish off the new look for Senior Citizen!!!!!! It's not really that different to the old look, but it's much clearer, and has more space for text!!!!! It should go live this weekend!!!!!! Bet you can't wait, huh!!!!!!!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.bradlands.com/dww/"><img align="right" border="0" class="picture_frame" src="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/dww/dw2-icon.gif"/></a>BTW I'll be taking part in this <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/dww/"><b>Day Without Weblogs</b></a> tomorrow, so there'll be no SC on 1st Dec. But we'll return the next day in our new look!!!!
