Well, Napster might be on it's <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_05_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1295443">last legs</a>, but that hasn't stopped the folks at <b>Weirdo.com</b> starting a <a href="http://www.weirdo.com/napster.x">netwebby versh</a> of it!!! You can now go an tha NetWeb, create an account, search Napster and Gnutella, and then resolutely not download any MP3s because of course it's very naughty!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So it's a bit like <b>My MP3.com</b> without the legal bits, and Napster without the program bits!!!!!
