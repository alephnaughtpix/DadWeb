Those peeps in Fleet Street are really quick off their mark!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I mean, check <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Terence_Blacker/blacker141100.shtml">this article</a> out!!!!!! This sharp dude called <b>Terence</b> has found out that on email you can apparently get flame messages <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/1.html#4">which can go too far</a>, messages which get <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/4.html#121">can get taken the wrong way</a>, and messages which dispense with the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#840509">normal formality of letters</a>!!!!!! In fact, far from being shielded by technology, email message are often a bit <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/15.html#442">more honest</a>!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Well, I never!!!!!!!!!!
