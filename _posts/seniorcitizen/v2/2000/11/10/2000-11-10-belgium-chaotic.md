Cripes!!!!!!!! Only a couple of days after I mention the old "<a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_05_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1275879">Do They Mean Us?</a>" prog from the olden days of tha tellybox, apparently the British Council has done a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Leading_articles/2000-11/leaderc101100.shtml">survey of attitudes to Britain from non-Brits</a>!!!!!!!!! And it's not exactly positive either!!!!! One Argentinian is quoted as saying:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">I'd rather live in a more chaotic place, some place more emotional, like Belgium.</div> <br/> <br/>Stop laughing at the back there!!!!!! Any country that's responsible for the evil brew that is <b>Hoegaarden</b> beer has got to be a little bit 'chaotic'!!!!!! (Or least it will be after a couple of pints of Hoegaarden!!!!!!)
