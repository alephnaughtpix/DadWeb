Well, we mentioned yesterday the problems some US folk have <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_05_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1316510">putting the pointy thing in the right hole</a>!!!!!!!!! But now the voting problems in the Florida state vote for the Prez have become a "usability interface" issue!!!!! At least, according to this page, amusingly titled "<a href="http://eleganthack.com/blog/2000_11_01_pastblog.html"><b>Usability bug chooses next president?</b></a>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!
