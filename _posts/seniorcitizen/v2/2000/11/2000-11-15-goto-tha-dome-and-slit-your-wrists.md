Well, I went to the <b>Millenium Dome</b>, and I didn't think it was that bad!!!!!!!!! But apparently some people think it's <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/pallister/archive/15-11-19100-21-52-30.html">really depressing</a>!!!!!!! Which just goes to show there are a lot of people in Britain with no life!!!!!!!!!
