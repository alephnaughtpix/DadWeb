<div class="quote">I love folkdance I can do - - I love x x x ... If can take good electrik I want many many times</div> <br/> <br/>Yes!!!!! Our old friend <b>Mahir</b> is <a href="http://members.nbci.com//_XMCM/primall/mahir/new.htm">back</a> after travelling all over the world!!!!!! He appears to be quite a good egg really, being in favour of famine aid, human rights, and so on... But he still hasn't found any girls tho!!!!!! Why ever not I wonder?!?!?!? I mean, check out the photo <a href="http://members.nbci.com//_XMCM/primall/mahir/new.htm">on the page</a> of him in his dancing days!!!!!! (Just above the words <i>"I must not change never"</i>...) What red-blooded female could resist such a King of the Disco Swing?!?!?!?!?!
