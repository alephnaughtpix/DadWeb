I'm typing this in an internet cafe- in the <b>Millenium Dome</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!! See, it's good for something!!!!!!!!!! So all you dome-knockers (Ooh-errr, that sounds a bit rude!!!!!!!!!!!) can stick that up yer lum!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I finally got to that big ferris wheel (aka the <b>London Eye</b>), and spent bloody ages queueing for a ticket only to find out that they were booked out hours in advance!!!!!!!!!!! I got a ticket for 4:30-5:00pm, so hopefully the sun won't have set by then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, here I am, at tha Dome!!!!!!!! It's interesting so far!!! I went on a rather spectacular fairground ride, which involved being strapped into a vehicle thingy, which was lifted up by magnetic coils!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then it was dropped to the ground!!!!!!!!!! Luckily some magnets at the other end slowed it down before everyone was squished!!!!!!!!!! I would have been most cross if those magnets didn't work!!!!! I notice they advise you to put your valuables in special containers on the ground to prevent them flying away or something!!!!!!!!!!! Which is really handy for them because if the machine goes wrong and everybody on the ride dies, then at least they've got your valuables safe!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I've only been in 3 "zones" so far... The <b>Money</b> one was absolute claptrap propaganda!!!!!!!! It was basically telling you not to worry too much about not having enough money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The <b>Work</b> zone was a bit more interesting, but I couldn't help feeling it was also trying to "mould" folk as well, especially some of the wacky "games", which looked suspsiciously like those funny "prometric" tests all those "human resources" suits are really keen on these days!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>The <b>Learning</b> zone was a bit better tho!!!!! It started with one going up an escalator to the strains of the theme from "Take Hart"!!!!! Then you entered the room, and it was a big school hall!!!!!!!!!! There was some young lady who acted as though she was a Headmistress!!!!!!!!!! And she had the cheek to say I was setting a bad example "to the other boys" by putting my hands in my pockets!!!!!!!!!! I countered that she was setting a bad example to the other girls by dressing in such a poor approximation of a St Trinians naughty schoolgirl!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Anyway, after the riot was cleared up, we were finally let into some big room, where some corny film was show on the screen for a bit involving some young girl who had obviously attended stage school rather than the real one portrayed in this one!!!!!!!!!! Then at the end the screen lifted up, and there was some massive mirrored room with loads of fake trees, and some old woman pretending to be the young lady in the film, inviting us in!!!!!!!! Then we went in, and found there was nothing in the room apart from some "interactive" trivia machines!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Then I went outside, and a few strange people acting strange to keep the people in the queues amused!!!!!!!!! Then I ventured into the centre of the Dome, and found this place!!!!!!!!!! Great huh!!!!!! ATM there's some bunch of kids on the stage opposite who appear to be doing the sort of performances one would get on "Michael Barrymore's 'My Kind of People'"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>OK, enough craptalk from me- I going to take a look in on that <b>Blackadder</b> programme!!!!!!!!!!!!
