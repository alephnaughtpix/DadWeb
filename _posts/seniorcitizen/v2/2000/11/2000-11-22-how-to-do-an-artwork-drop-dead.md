Have you ever wondered how to make people remember you when you pop your clogs??!?!?! Well, perhaps you can put something on the wall from you for people in future generations to look at!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>No, I am not talking about committing suicide by blowing off your head with a double-barrelled shotgun, having previously written a will stipulating that a certain wall in the house will never be cleaned!!!!!!!! I am in fact talking about this bunch called <a href="http://www.memorialart.com/"><b>Eternally Yours</b></a>, who take <i>"a small portion of cremains"</i> (?!?!?) and make a painting out of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I bet that'll be a lot of fun in the future, when everyone is supposed to have tons of <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#832859">nanobots</a> inside them!!!!!!! Wot if there's a bunch of nanobots left in the remains and they disagree with the artists design concept?!??!?! Will they "nanobotize" tha painting, and turn it into a Picasso stylee piccy just to annoy him/her?!?!?!??!<br/><br/>He/She would be pretty "cheesed off", I imagine!!!!!!!!! But I expect the nanobots would be falling on the floor laughing!!!!!!!!! If they're actually on the floor of course!!!!!!! But they're probably not!!!!!! They're probably on the painting!!!!! Because they've "nanobotized" the... OK, I'll shut up now!!!!!!
