Now this is vaguely interesting!!!!! Some columnist in the <b>Glasgow Herald</b> has offered an illluminating insight into the complexity of the Christian faith in Scotland- and he's explained in terms of a brown liquid!!!!!!!!!! Yes, he's explaining the churches in terms of <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/ferguson/archive/2-11-19100-21-23-3.html">coffee</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Think Presbyterianism, think coffee. The Church of Scotland, to which I belong, is the decaffeinated version of Presbyterianism. It's a bit bland, worthy, and generally kindly: a broad Church, with all the strengths and weaknesses that term implies. The United Free Church is also decaff. As you move to the right, starting with the Free Kirk and moving through the Free Kirk (Continuing) to the Reformed and Associated Presbyterian Churches - plus the other theological splinter groups whose differences cannot be observed by the naked eye - the caffeine gets stronger and stronger. In fact, the granules become positively nuclear. When you reach the outer fringes, you're taking 100% proof intravenously; you're in the specialist territory for serious addicts.</div> <br/> <br/>No wonder a lot of those fundamentalist types act so wacky!!!!!!!!! They probably have trouble getting to sleep!!!!!!!!!!
