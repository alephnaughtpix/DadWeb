Hey!!!! This is good news for old Net vets like me!!!! By which I of course mean internet veterans, not fishnet vetenarians!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>According to <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/rcfoc/column001106.htm">some survey</a>, apparently people who use the internet a lot are not socially deprived morons!!!!! <br/> <br/>Well, to be honest, I could have told you that!!!!!! I mean, anyone reading this cannot help but be impressed with my immense intellect and cultured outlook on life, can they?!?!??!?!
