Hey!!!!! Have you noticed the slight change!??!?!?! The quotes all have different coloured headlines!!!!!<br/><br/>So bloody wot you might say!!!!! But this is merely the first step in the soon-coming design revamp!!!!!!! I've seperated the format of the headlines for the quotes and stories, and moved the location of the stylesheet URL!!!!! It's a bit like the webby equivalent of moving the <b>Kingston Bridge</b> three inches to the South!!!!!

As for the revamp, I can promise... Well, I can't promise anything, really!!!!! I haven't finished the design yet!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!
