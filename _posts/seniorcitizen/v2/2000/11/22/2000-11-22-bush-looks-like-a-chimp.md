While this big bunfight over who's going to be El Presidente de la US is still going on, here's an interesting page about the bloke who is (currently) ahead!!!!!!!!!! Apparently there's a good reason <b>George W Bush</b> thinks it's <i>"not Reaganesque to support a tax plan that is Clinton in nature"</i> and wants to have a <i>"foreign-handed foreign policy"</i>, and other <a href="http://slate.msn.com/Features/bushisms/bushisms.asp">funny things</a>!!!!!!!!!! He <a href="http://gwbchimp.8m.com/">looks like a chimpanzee</a>!!!!!!!!!!
