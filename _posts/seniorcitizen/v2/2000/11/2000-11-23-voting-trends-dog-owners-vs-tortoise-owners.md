<div class="quote">I bet the proportion of dog-owners who vote Conservative is significantly higher than, say, of people who own a tortoise.</div><br/><br/>This is a most <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Mark_Steel/steel231100.shtml">interesting article</a>!!!!!!!!!!!! I can see that young Tory chap <b>William Hague</b> jumping on the "Dog Owners" bandwagon now!!!!!!!!!! You can imagine him talking to that "Loaded" maggy in his Yorkshire-accent-with-jaws-wired-together type voice: <i>"Oh well, I think dogs are really great pets, much better than those liberal politically correct metropolitan wine-bar frequenting tortoises!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!
