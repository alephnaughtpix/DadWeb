Well, you don't need to tell me how incredibly boring some US rock mags are!!!!!!! I mean, <b>Rolling Stone</b>- presumably so called because it's about as interesting as a watching a boulder in transit!!!!!! And <b>Spin</b>- even the name suggests "hype"!!!!!!!!! So it's not too surprising to see some folks on tha NetWeb <a href="http://www.flagpole.com/Issues/02.10.99/rockcritics.html">agree with me</a>!!!!!!! Apparently the main problems are:<br/><ol type="a"> <br/><li>The bands are boring!!!!!!!!<br/><li>The writers are boring!!!!!!!!<br/><li>The record companies virtually run the show!!!!! (And they're not very interesting either!!!!!!)<br/></li></li></li></ol> <br/> <br/>Sounds like everyone concerned needs a good kick up the tradesmans entrance if you ask me!!!!!
