Just to bring things up to date... I had a couple of pints in some pub called <b>Coopers</b> in the Victoria train station!!!!!!!! And I was blethering away with various people about how expensive things are in London!!!!!! Then we got chucked out due to some antiquated licensing law in England which says that pubs have to shut at 10:30pm!!!!!! It's just as well tho- that's when I had to go for my bus!!!!!! BTW does anyone know why on earth they can have an express train service straight to Heathrow airport from Victoria railway station, but they put the flippin' Victoria bus station miles away?!?!?!?! <br/> <br/>Well, the bus journey up to Glasgow was not too bad!!!!!!!! I managed to get to sleep despite some flapping bit of machinery that kept tapping arhythmically at the back, sounding not unlike a lunatic with a tambourine!!!!!! I have to say tho, I pity the folks who had to stay on the bus after Glasgow- it was going all the way up to Aberdeen in time for 11 o' clock in the morning!!!! Imagine have to spend 12 hours in a bus with that bloody tapping!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Finally I got home and crawled into my bed!!!!!!!!!!! And now I'm up!!!!!! Tomorrow I'm taking the camera film down to tha megamighty Boots!!!!!<br/> <br/>Er... And that's it!!!!!! <b>The End</b>!!!!!!!!!
