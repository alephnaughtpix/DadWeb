Crickey!!!!! It's like <b>Johnny Rotten</b> saying he likes <b>The Corrs</b>!!!!!!!!! Just check out this sniffy little review of <b>Matt Drudge</b>'s new book, which is titled: "<b><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,39871,00.html">Review: Drudge, as in Sludge</a></b>"!!!!!! Apparently it's badly written and Drudge is a bit full of himself!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Fair enough, but then we get a lot of self-righteous nonsense about how Drudge's w3site and internet publishing in general:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">But Drudge's shtick about being a virtual high-priest of democracy sounds hollow, as does his repeated claims that the Internet will render all other media irrelevant. ("TV is dead," he claims.) <br/> <br/>First, as Drudge points out, he made his name at a time when established media had not yet taken to the Internet, or at least not in a serious way. Now they have. The window of opportunity for freebooters to loom large has closed. <br/> <br/>Second, the fact that anyone can set up shop at home just as Drudge did also dilutes the impact of any single individual -- or worse. <br/> <br/>"The problem I'm seeing immediately is if other Drudge Reports pop up -- and they will -- it is romantic to have one person running down the street screaming, 'Extra! extra!' but if you have a thousand it could start looking like an insane asylum," Drudge told a National Press Club gathering in June 1998. "So, if indeed we start having tens of thousands of people all reporting news, hundreds of channels reporting news, all the different cable channels -- click, click, click -- I think people will grow disinterested."</div> <br/> <br/>Erm, so can we assume that this is not Wired News being jealous of Matt Drudge's "Report" starting off the whole "Zippergate" business, and thus affecting the mainstream news media in a way that Wired never did?!?!?!?! And surely the Wired folks can't in any be getting all huffy with the great unwashed moving into their territory, and publishing stuff on "their" internet?!?!?! Hang on, I thought that's what you buffons wanted in the first place!!!!!! But now it's clear that it hasn't quite turned out like a Californian Age of Aquarius, you seem to changing your colours pretty quickly!!!!!<br/> <br/>Sounds like a case of that "Californication" lark that those Red Hot Chilli Pepper chappies seem to be going on about these days!!!!!!!
