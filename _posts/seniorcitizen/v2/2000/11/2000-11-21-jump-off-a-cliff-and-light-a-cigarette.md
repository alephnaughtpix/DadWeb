Well, I never!!!!!!!! According to some survey, apparently sensation seekers are <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/21-11-19100-0-57-35.html">more likely to take up smoking</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So next time you hear some bungee jumper say they do it because it makes them feel more "alive", you can always say <i>"Ho ho!!!!! We'll see about that, won't we!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
