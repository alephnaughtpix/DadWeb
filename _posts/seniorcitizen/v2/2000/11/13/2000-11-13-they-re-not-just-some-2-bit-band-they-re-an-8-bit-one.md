OK, we've already had a C64 tune in the UK charts by Dave Whittaker!!!!! (ie Kernkraft 400's "Zombie Nation", which is ripped off the music for the "Stardust" section of C64 game "Lazy Jones"!!!!!!) So this lot might have a bit of a chance!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Check out <a href="http://www.minibosses.com/"><b>Minibosses</b></a>, who do cover versions of stuff, like the theme tunes to <b>Ghosts and Goblins</b> and <b>Castlevania</b>!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Of course the great thing about this is that if they say any naughty words in the songs, no-one will notice the extra bleepy noises if they beep it out!!!!!!!
