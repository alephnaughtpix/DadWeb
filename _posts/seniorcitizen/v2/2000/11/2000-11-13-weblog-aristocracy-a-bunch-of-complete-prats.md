Well, I'd better be careful here, because I think one of people mentioned here might have been indirectly responsible for SC becoming <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_08_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1079810">Blog of the Week</a> not so long ago!!!!!!!!!!! But ah so wot, this next article is a good laugh!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The person here is reacting to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pyrafan2000/newyorker.html">some <b>New York Times</b> article</a>, using it as an excuse to vent their spleen about how a lot of top Bloggers who get all the media attention are not there because of their brilliance, but are in fact the Blogging equivalent of <a href="http://www.fawny.org/decon-blog.html">media whores</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And I'm supposed to be surprised at this??!?!?! I would have thought you'd just need to take a look at some blogs to see how egotistical some of these folks are!!!!!!! Sometimes it's like reading a badly written episode of "Big Brother"!!!!!!!!!! Only less interesting!!!!!!!! Or readable!!!!!!!!!
