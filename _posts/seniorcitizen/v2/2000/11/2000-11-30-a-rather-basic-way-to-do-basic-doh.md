U-no, one of my friends has got one of those new-fangled <b>Playstation 2</b> thingies!!!!!!!!! And the thing that's been most played on it so far has not been any game, but this version of ye olde computing language BASIC, called <b><a href="http://www.yabasic.de/">YABASIC</a></b>!!!!!!!! You can download it for Windows and *nix, but it's much more entertaining watching someone programming it using just an analogue controller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
