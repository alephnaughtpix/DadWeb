Hey!!!!! This sounds like a great idea!!!!!!!! Someone's made some contraption to read a specially printed <a href="http://www.findthedot.com/">funny little ink splodge</a> printed on a page next in a product catalogue!!!!!! Then it can link up with your compute, and get it to email details of the products back to you!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Which sounds really spiffy, as I can't get enough of good ol' spam mail!!!!!!!! (Actually, I'm joking there!!!!!!!!!!)
