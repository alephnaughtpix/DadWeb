U-no, I used to think "<b>Micromedia</b>" was some computer telly show from the 1980s which featured Fred Harris and Ian McNaught-Davis!!!!!!!!!! But I was wrong!!!!!!! In fact, there's no "BBC model B" in <a href="http://www.publish.com/features/0011/feature4.html">this article</a> about "Micromedia"!!!!!!!!! Apparently it's all about <i>"nascent communities of interest"</i>, whatever that means!!!!!!!!! But apparently it has something to do with weblogs, just like the one wot you are reading at this very moment!!!!!! Only we of course started it before Blogger came along!!!!!! Honest!!! <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/1.html">Look</a>!!!!!!
