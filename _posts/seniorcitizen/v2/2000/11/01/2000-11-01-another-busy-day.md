Well, I've been faffing about with Flash, jostling about with Javascript, and attacking ASCII files today!!!!!! And I've had absolutely flip all time to do stuffs for <b>SC</b>!!!!! In fact, I've only got time to tell you I don't have time to do anything else!!!!!!!! Harumph!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>BTW I am actually going to London this weekend!!!!! From Friday to Monday!!!!!!! I dunno if I'll be able to get as much written when I'm down there, as I was in <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/paris/">Paris</a> tho!!!!!! I mean, it's not the continent of Europe!!!! They might look on "internet terminals" as new fangled down there!!!!! And also, the poor folks in the South of England have been getting battered by the elements (wind, rain, snow, tornados, etc!) recently!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>So I'll be lucky if the electricity's still on when I get down there!!!!!!!!!!
