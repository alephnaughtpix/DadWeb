Droplift!!!!!!!!! No, I'm not talking about a new technique for plastic surgery here!!!!!!!!! I'm in fact talking about a new method of music distribution!!!!!!!!!!! According to this site, "Droplifting" is a technique whereby one sneakily <a href="http://www.droplift.org/pressrelease.html">inserts a CD into a record shop without them noticing</a>!!!!!!!!! Suprisingly enough, a lot of the folks <a href="http://www.droplift.org/artists.html">who are in favour of it</a> use a lot of unauthorised samples!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Still!!!!! At last, <a href="http://www.mp3.com/pritstik/"><b>PritStik</b></a> can find a way to get their records into the shops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
