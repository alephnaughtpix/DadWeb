Have you ever wanted to make a sizeable statement of intent regarding the questionable effects of the sizeable power of consumerist culture!??!?!??!?! Well, now you can- by failing to go to tha shop tomorrow!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yes, apparently tomorrow (Nov 24) is <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/"><b>International Buty Nothing Day</b></a>!!!!!!!!! So perhaps you can forgo the light lunch at some fast food joint for a delightful packed-lunch excursion in the park or something!!!!
