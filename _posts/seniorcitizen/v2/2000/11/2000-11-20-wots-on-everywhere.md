Crikey!!!!! Those sniffy listings mags like <b>Time Out</b>, who act like they're really cosmopolitan, had better watch out!!!!!!!!! Here's <a href="http://www.whatsgoingon.com/"><b>What's Going On</b></a>, a website devoted to covering what to do- anywhere in the world!!!!!!!! 

According to today's edition, there's a <a href="http://www.whatsgoingon.com/event/event/0102515341/">"Monarch Butterfly Migration"</a> happening in Angangueo, Michoacan, Mexico, and a <a href="http://www.whatsgoingon.com/event/event/0011512853/">"Wind Symphony Concert"</a> happening in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA!!!!!!!!!!! 

Well, that's all from me today, I've got to jump on a plane now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
