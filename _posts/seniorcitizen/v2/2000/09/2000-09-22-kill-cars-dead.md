Wot a surprise to see this one coming from a place where they still have the death penalty!!!!! Some peeps in California are trying to pass the death penalty- for cars!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>The law asks for new cars to be fitted with a remote control "kill" switch so that if the police are chasing them- they can remotely <a href="http://technocrat.net/968678895/">turn the car "off"</a>!!!!<br/> <br/>Only prob with that- what if a robber steals a police car!!!!!! And they can't exactly put "kill" switches on their own cars, as it means some miscreant just has to steal the remote control, and use it on them!!!!!!!! Or, erm, maybe the robbers could just take the switch out of the car!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Seems a bit of dim idea to me!!!! But then again, this is the US we're talking about here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
