Honestly!!! First it was GM food, then GM whisky, then GM plantpots!!! Now... GM coffee!!! Some scientests have found out how to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20000830/aponline140010_000.htm">get rid of the caffeine gene in coffee</a>!!!! And I bet they think this is really clever of them!!!! What next- GM Ale that doesn't get you drunk?!?!?!
