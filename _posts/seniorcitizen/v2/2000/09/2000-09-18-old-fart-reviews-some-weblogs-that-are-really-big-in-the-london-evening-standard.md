Well, OK, maybe I am being a bit harsh about the above story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So I might as well be fair and give the weblogs mentioned in the article a quick lookee over!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Now as usual with reviews, this is my personal opinion etc etc!!!!!!! One thing I notice is that a great amount of folks seem to have stopped using capitals on their titles!!!! Presumably because, it's a little bit boring!!!!!!!!!! (In which case, look at our logo for some tips on how to <b>really</b> use caps and lowercase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/><ul> <br/><li><a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/"><b>plasticbag.org</b></a>- Boring!!!!!!!! <br/><li><b><a href="http://www.notsosoft.com/blog/index.html">No-so-soft</a></b>- not bad!!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.riothero.com/">riothero</a></b>- nice design, shame about the content!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.kitschbitch.com/">Kitschbitch</a></b>- ace design, (especially the <a href="http://www.kitschbitch.com/images/labitch2.gif">piccy</a>!!!) but a bit boring on the content front!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.launch.nu/momblog/">Momblog</a></b>- not entirely my cup of tea, but it's got a nice design and it's pretty well written!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.fourohfour.net/">fourohfour</a></b>- Just like MTV's "The Real World" as a weblog- bllleeeuuurrrghhhh!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/">vavatch orbital </a></b>- this is more interesting!!! A man with a plan- Mars!!!!!!!! And he writes a lot!!!!!!!!!! And he's even discovered that old warhorse of sci-fi ezines, <a href="http://www.intertext.com/">Intertext</a>!!!! Cripes, I thought everyone had forgotten about that lot!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.rubberducky.nu/girl/breasts/">The Breast Chronicles</a></b>- a weblog, by and for mammaries!!!!!!!!!!! Erm, interesting "analysis" of the "issues" surrounding (often quite literally!!!!!!!!!) the upper region of womenfolk of course...<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.geocities.com/londonjournal/">Kylie and Scott go to London</a></b>- Aussies paint the town red!!!!!!!! Well, they could have, I suppose- it would have made for a much more interesting weblog!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.melaniebray.com/confessions.asp">Confessions of a Wannabee Actor</a></b>- Oh dear, that ominous word "confession"!!!! And a quote from Anne flippin' DiFranco!!!!!!!!! And an actor!!!!!!!!!! Head-up-anus time?!??!?! Well, it's not actually that bad really, as our Brian Molko lookalike heroine discuss the difference between fillm butterfiles and theatre butterflies, and other such minutae!!!!!!!!!! Nice design as well...<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.pixeldiva.co.uk/damaged/">Damaged</a></b>- Nice design on the main weblog site, but not really that much to it... The <a href="http://www.pixeldiva.co.uk/journal/">journal</a> section is decent tho.<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.thesmack.com/">The Smack</a></b>- Hey!!!!!! This one's quite good!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.newfer.org/">Doglog</a></b>- hey!!! Slashdot for dogs!!!!!! In fact, they could have called it <b>SlashDog</b>, except that the RSPCA might get a bit cross!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><li><b><a href="http://www.cockybastard.com/">Cocky Bastard</a></b>- Hoho!!!!!!! And he thinks he's cocky does he?!?!?!?! Still nice design- and good to see someone's out there kicking bottom, even if they're not doing as well as I am of course!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul> <br/>So, in general some not-too-bad ones out there!!!!!!! Just wait till they get as good as SenCit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then they'll really be cooking!!!!!!
