One of my friends often calls random people "foamholes"- at random times!!!!!!!!! When I ask what a "foamhole" is, he says he doesn't know, but it sounds "cool"!!!!!!!!! Well, this week, we could have found a possible candidature for this somewhat undefinable word!!!! There's a big hole in Spain, and it's been <a href="http://www.discovery.com/news/earthalert/000905/index/phenomenon_index.html">foaming away for 6 weeks</a>, and no-one has the foggiest why!!!!!!!!!
