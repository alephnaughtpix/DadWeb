 You know, being such an old codger, it really warms the cockles of my heart to see an article which predicts my existance!!!!!!! Apparently, the NetWeb is giving rise to a new international language which has been termed <b> <a href="http://www.writetheweb.com/read.php?item=64">Weblish</a></b>!!!!! (Only prob with this is that "weblish" is also used as a term for publishing on tha W3!!!!!!!!) Apparently it's really "rich" (Which is total crap, because I don't get any money off it!!!!) and it <a href="http://www.scotlandonsunday.co.uk/week.cfm?id=SS00025842&amp;d=Week&amp;c=columnists&amp;s=9">really cheeses off some linguist dinosaurs</a>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Goodness knows what they'll think of my spiffy "dialect" versh of it as displayed here!!!!! I dunno what I would call it, but here are a few suggestions!!!!<br/><ul><br/><li>Fart-ish!!!!!!<br/><li>Senior-Speak!!!!!<br/><li>Fart-talk!!!!!!<br/><li>Citizen-Craptalk!!!!!<br/><li>Dada-Gaga!!!!!<br/><li>Fartophone!!!!!<br/><li>Dad-Mouthing!!!!<br/><li>Farty-Gab!!!<br/><li>Senio-Sound!!!!<br/><li>Old Farts!!!<br/><li>Gas!!!!<br/><li>Crap!!!!<br/><li>Erm, I'm out of ideas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
