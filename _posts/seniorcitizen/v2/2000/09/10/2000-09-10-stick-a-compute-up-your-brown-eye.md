You know that spiffing bit in that otherwise overrated movie "<a href="http://www.chisp.net/~bwood/quadro/"><b>Quadrophenia</b></a>" (Which I thought was supposed to be some Sci-Fi move about people with four ears, until I saw it, and it was actually about some bunch of beatnik "mods"- and they didn't even use a <a href="http://www.maz-sound.com/trackers_without_frames.html">soundtracker</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!) Ahem anyway, if you've seen the movie, there's a pretty good bit where the hero (Well, he's supposed to be the hero, but for what reason is another matter!!!! I mean what does he do?!?!? Goes to a couple of parties, goes to Brighton and fights some rockers, loses his job, takes a load of drugs, then drives his bike off a cliff!!!!! Not exactly Arnie material here!!!!!!!!) Woops, where was I?!?!?! Oh yes, the good bit- he tells his boss to take his job and stick it right up his "<a href="http://chooser.mp3.com/cgi-bin/play/play.cgi/AAICQgb7BADABG5vcm1QBAAAAFICpQAAUQEAAABDQZCaOcVaeybI9IOrtCNmTg7krVY-/were_gonna_need_a_bigger_t.m3u">arse</a>"!!!!!! <br/><br/>So bloody wot, I hear you say!!!!!!!!!! Well, if he was from the company in this article, his boss would have said "OK, then!!!!"!!!!!!!! That's because the "job" would refer to <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/07/chips/print.html">a computerised ID tracking chip</a>, to be inserted in a certain place!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Well, at least, that's the impression from this article, which seems to think that the most likely place human ID would be implanted would be the "left butt cheek"!!!!!!!!!!! If it's going to be a small glass capsule, <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/10/20/cyborg/print.html">like the one in this bloke</a>, isn't that going to make sitting down a little uncomfortable?!?!??!?!?!?
