When you listen to newspapers, you generally don't hear a lot from them!!!!! At the most, you get "rustle" from them!!!!! And the online webby news-sites tend to be even less useful in the noise department!!!! But that might not be the case in the future!!!!!! There's a new XML-base webby language out now called <a href="http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/training/voicexml/voicexmloverview.html"><b>VoiceXML</b></a>!!! It allows you to do webpages which can be read by special "voice browsers" will read out your webpages!!!!! A lot of this can be applied as stylesheets to existing webpages, and add background music, select a different voice "font", and so on!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Hmmmm.... I wonder if I would be able to fix up a sound stylesheet in such as way that when a voice browser reads a webpage, it sounds like a crazy wacky radio show?!??!? Dunno wot those tabloids would sound like put through a voice browser tho!!!!!!!!!! Probably sound like that annoying bloke down the pub!!!!!!!!!<br/>
