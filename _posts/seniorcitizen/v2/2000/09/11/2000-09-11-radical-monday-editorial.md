Amazing!!!! Rather than complaining <i>about</i> the French, the Brits are complaining <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_919000/919801.stm"><b>with</b> the French</a>!!!!!!!! Cripes!!! I'd never thought I'd see the day when UK folks join a Europe-wide industrial action!!!!! The fact that they actually got off the backsides and actually did anything at all is a bloody miracle!!!!!!! I'm shocked!!!!! In a pleasant way of course- and it's mainly old blokes as well!!!! Young whippersnappers please take note!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And on this Radical Monday, I bet you can't help to notice the radical "new-look" layout of <b>Senior Citizen</b>, which uses CSS and other bells and whistles!!!!!! I think it looks bloody brilliant myself!!!!!!! There will be a few tweaks and so on, and I also want to add a FAQ and stuff, so the upgrade is not totally finished yet, but it's nearly there!!!!!<br/> <br/>Like the crap daily quotes?!??!?! I've got this cheesy calendar at work with a crap quote per day!!!!! I thought I might as well use it to fill space!!!!!!!! Of course, if you've got any better quotes, why not mail us!?!?!
