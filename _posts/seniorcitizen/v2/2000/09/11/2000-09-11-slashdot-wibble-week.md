You know, I'm an old man!!!!!!!!!!! But I feel even older now!!!!!!! Because one of the things I remember from my youth is now being talked of in the same terms as those old pre-Web bulletin boards in California that all those boring sociologists thought marked the beginning of the bloody Age of Aquarius!!!!!!!!!!! Even more, amazing, it's flippin' <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/"><b>Slashdot</b></a>, which this bunch are looking at as a <a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue5_9/baoill/">model of a "public space"</a>!!!!!!!!! For the past couple of years, it's been more like space for Public Assholes!!!!!!!! And it seems someone on tha NetWeb <a href="http://www.linuxpower.org/display.php?id=195">finally agrees with me</a>!!!!!!!!
