Ahh... Doesn't it give you a warm feeling in your cockles!!!! In the UK, some fuel protester are wanting to take us back to the good old days of <a href="http://www.socialist.net/64/labour1979.html">zillions of strikes, rubbish being uncollected, dead being unburied, dogs howling, slaughter of the first born, terrible sideburns, etc., etc</a>., ...<br/> <br/>Yep, it looks like some are planning a re-run of the 1979 <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml">Winter of Discontent</a></b>!!!!! (Funny how you don't see any of this represented at any of those cheesy "70s" club nights, isn't it!!!!!!! Maybe they should have about 10 minutes during the night where the DJ goes on "strike"!!!!!!!!! Then the bar staff do "secondary picketing" or something!!!!! They're usually very good at "picketing" their nostrils so it should be second nature!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem anyway!!!!! There is one important difference!!!! This time it might happen on tha NetWeb as well!!!! <br/> <br/>It's all thanks to our old friend <b>Herbless</b>- who has improved his design skills a little since <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#867558">last time</a>!!!! On his latest hack, he calls for <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/09/19/www.banking.hsbc.co.uk/mirror.html">politically motivated hacking of UK webbysites</a>. Tho I notice in his "Things to keep in mind" section, he doesn't say: <i>"Use a decent design!!!!! Black text on a dark red background is very hard to read!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!
