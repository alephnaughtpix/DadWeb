Is it me, or is that <b>Big Brother</b> show on tha tellybox really really really boring?!??!?!?!??!!?!! I've only watched that episode where Nick gets turfed out, and even that was incredibly boring!!!!!! "Nasty Nick"!?!?!? More like "Not-very-interesting Nick"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And he was the least uninteresting of the folk!!!!! Even worse was that Tom dude, who speaks very slowly!!!! And that Nicola woman who thinks shes really "extrovert" and an "individual", when in fact she comes across as someone who is about as subversive as a wacky "yoof" TV presenter!!!!!!!!! And people are apparently "addicted" to this tosh, because well, they're on TV, and therefore must be inherently more "interesting"!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And guess wot!!!! It's even worse in the US, where in their versh of the show, at least the contestants have got enough backbone to start getting cheesed off with the producers trying to prod them to do silly "tasks" like fashion shows and "songs", and are threatening to stage a <a href="http://www.infobeat.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=2569618030-ae6">walkout</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>They're not the only ones!!!!!! There are a couple of <a href="http://www.bigbrotherblows.com/">anti-BB</a> sites on tha W3!!!!!!
