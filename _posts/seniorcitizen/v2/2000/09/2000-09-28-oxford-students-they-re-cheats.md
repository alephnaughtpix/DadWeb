Well, now we know why so many people from Oxbridge are complete idiots!!!!!!!!!! Not only should we blame the "old boy network" (Which I notice misses out "old boys" such as myself- presumably because of my massive intellect!!!!!!!) but it's also the fault of "cheat-em-up" NetWeb sitez like the one described in <a href="http://asia.dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/technology/afp/article.html?s=asia/headlines/000920/technology/afp/Oxford_students_launch_homework-dodging_website.html">this story</a>!!!!! It's called "<a href="http://www.revise.it/reviseit/default.asp"><b>revise.it</b></a>", although a much better title might be "bluff.it"!!!!!! One of the young whippersnappers in change says:<br/><br/><div class="quote">Exams are a fight. It's us against them. If they don't catch us, we win. If they do, well...</div><br/><br/>... Presumably you get "ragged" in the "dorm" by the "head boy", or whatever it is they do in these antiquated higher educational establishments!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Dunno why this story is in the Asia News section of Yahoo tho!!!! Maybe they think Oxford students don't look there!!!!! Which is a bit dim really, because if I can find a hidden away news article like this, then anyone can!!!!!!! And it's not really hidden away if you're from Asia and regularly read the news section!!!!!!!!!!
