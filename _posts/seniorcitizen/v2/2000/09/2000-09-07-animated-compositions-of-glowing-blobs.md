When I were a lad (!!!!!!), I was into all this <a href="http://www.scene.org">demo scene stuffs</a>!!!!! Now it seems "intelligent" and "arty" people are getting into them- except they're calling them <i>"multimedia installations"</i> or similar bollox!!!!! And just like the old 16-bit demo days, there's a couple of "demo construction kit" programs floatings, only they are of course not demo construction kits, because that's a bit too "populist" and "mainstream", and other snobby euphemisms!!!!!!!! No, this proggy here is a <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/golan/aves/index.html"><i>"Audiovisual Environment Suite"</i></a>!!!!! And you can tell the person behind it is "serious" because he's from MIT, and not some 12 year-old from Sweden!!!!!! Tho to be honest, it's hard to tell the difference between the MIT stuff and the usual PC demos these days!!!! Apart  from the fact that the MIT versh can't be bothered to do a module soundtrack for their demos, and instead have "sonified" them with some bloody awful algorithmic droning from various hugely expensive synthesisers!!!!!!!
