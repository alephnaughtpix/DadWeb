Well, you'll like this one if you're "down with da 'hood" as they say- in the business!!!!!! And that business is of course dentistry!!!!! That's because this person here is a dentist to the stars of tha wordy rappinghood!!!!!<br/> <br/>So next time you see a talented young chap rapping on tha tellybox about how big and tough he is, especially in the trouser department, then remember that not so long ago, <a href="http://www.rapperdentist.com/">this little man</a> was drilling into his molars!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Mind you there's one odd thing- check out the photo section. In all the proper b/w publicity photos, you <a href="http://www.rapperdentist.com/photos.html">can't see anyones teeth</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Not exactly great advertising for this dentist person, is it!!!!!!!!!!!<br clear="all"/>
