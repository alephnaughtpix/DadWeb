That funny little man from the Western Isles wot does stuff for the Glasgow Herald was complaining recently that no-one apparently takes <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/macleod/archive/12-9-19100-23-36-45.html">Hell</a> that seriously these days!!!!! Well, he obviously hasn't seen stuff like <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0045/0045_01.asp">this little beauty</a>, in which Hell is a company boardroom, the Devil is a Commander Riker lookalike with ridiculous Batman cape, and likes watching "Bewitched"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What's even more amazing is that it's done by evangelical Christians!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>BTW I didn't know you could die from just an LSD flashback!!!! And where did all those bandages on her face come from if it was all just a flashback?!?!?!?!?!? And what's all this nonsense about "one world govermment" and "ecumenical movement" stuff at the start all about?!?!??!?!<br/> <br/>If you ask me, the real question is what stuff the comic artist was on when he did this!!!!!!!!!!
