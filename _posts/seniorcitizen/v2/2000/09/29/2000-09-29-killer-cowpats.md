Never mind death by LSD flashback, I think death by cowpats sounds much more unpleasant if you ask me!!!!!!!! But according to <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/28-9-19100-23-8-23.html">this article</a>, it's possible!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"The treated mains public supply is safe, but some private supplies could be contaminated upstream by, say, a sheep."</div> <br/> <br/>Death by sheep?!?!?!? That sounds even worse!!!!!!!! Yuk!!!!!!!!!!!
