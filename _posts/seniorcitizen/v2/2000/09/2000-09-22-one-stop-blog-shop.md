The main prob with all the weblogging around is that it's so easy to do, that everyone and their dog can do it!!!!!!!!!!! And therefore, everyone <a href="http://www.newfer.org/">and their dog</a> <b>is</b> doing it!!!!!!! So it can be a bit of pain in the bottom to find decent weblogs inbetween the ones that do stuffs like:<br/> <br/><div class="usenet">got up. watched tv. it sucked. <br/>went out to the mall. talked to a chick. she told me to go f= myself. bitch, huh? whatever. <br/>went home. listened to cd. slipnot ROCKS!!!! <br/>went to bed. feel asleep. migth have snored a bit [etc...]<br/></div> <br/> <br/>... or the pseudy characters who write exactly the same claptrap as above, but in an even more unreadable style!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Fume, fume!!!! Erm, anyway!!!!!!! There's now a new webby dirsite for this sort of stuff, called <a href="http://www.blogstart.com/"><b>BlogStart</b></a>, and it divides up tha w3logz into Yahoo-style directories!!!!!!! So now you can avoid crappy logs by avoiding the "Personal Weblogs" directory!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Only prob is- you're probably likely to pick a log in another dir which looks useful, then when goto tha webbysite the first entry sez: <i>"got up. watched tv. it sucked. [etc.]"</i> AAaaarrrggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
