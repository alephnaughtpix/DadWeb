Ah, I remember the old days!!!!!!!! When you could only get 8 colours on a compute!!!!!! And they were mostly shades between red and muddy brown!!!!!!!!! And not so long ago, you have 16 bit computes with around 16 colours out of a choice of 512!!!!! <br/><br/>Yes, but those days are gone, aren't they, I hear you sob!!!!!!!!!! Well, not necessarily!!!!! You can return to the old days of limited pallettes by making your the colours in your website "websafe" in 16 bit "hi-colour" mode!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yep, <b><a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/">Webmonkey</a></b>, one of the few remaining relics left from the long dead <b>Hotwired</b>, have done a little <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/templates/print_template.htmlt?meta=/webmonkey/00/37/index2a_meta.html">investigation</a> into the old traditional "web safe" color palette which was used on web browsers in the old 256-colour VGA days, and whether it worked any more or not!!!!!!<br/><br/>What they found was that in 16-bit "hi-colour" mode, only <b>22</b> of the original 216 websafe colors were actually websafe, and <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/stuff2a/complete_websafe_216/reallysafe_palette.html">most of those colours are shade of green</a>!!!!!!!!! So if you use this palette, not only will be websafe- it'll be reallly enviromentally friendly as well!!!!!!!!
