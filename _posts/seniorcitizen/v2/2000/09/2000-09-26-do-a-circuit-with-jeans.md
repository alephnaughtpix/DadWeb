Well, not really!!!!!! More like a circuit with <b>genes</b>!!!!! Actually, it's not quite genes, but the bit of genes wot is called DNA!!!!!!! Apparently you'll soon be able to make circuits from <a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/original/article/print/0,5749,12544,00.html"><b>DNA "wires"</b></a>!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Not bad going for a Double Helix!!!!!! (Hang on, doesn't that sound like the title of an episode for Star Trek: Voyager?!?!??!?!?!?)
