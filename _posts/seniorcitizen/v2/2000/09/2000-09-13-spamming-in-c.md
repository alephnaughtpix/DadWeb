Have you ever completed a fabby new program in VIC Basic, and thought: <i>"Hmmm!!! Maybe I should spam it to squillions of newsgroups!!!!!!!!!"</i> Well, maybe not- but you <i>might</i> if it was someone else's!!!!! <br/> <br/>Take <a href="http://www.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=668032712&amp;fmt=text">this example</a>... In amongst all those <i>"Live Amsterdam Rumpy-Pumpy!!!!"</i> type bollox spam was spread a C program!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So what would possess someone to spam a C prog?!?!?!?! Well, take a closer look- it's our old friend, <b>DeCSS</b>, the DVD decrypter that the movie industry are not too hot on!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Of course, this could start a trend!!!!! Loads of people could release C program listings for one's compute, just like the old BBC Basic listings in BBC Micro User!!!!!! In fact, some spammer could be really nasty, label their C prog "DeCSS", someone downloads it and runs it, and it says on the screen: <i>"Now we've caught your attention, why not point your browser to Live Amsterdam Rumpy-Pumpy at http://www.liveamsterdamrumpypumpy.com/"</i>!!!!!!!!!
