This US Presidential race is getting interesting!!!! Both the two candidates are going on about how wholesome and moral they are- and they're called <b>Bush</b> and <b>Gore</b>!!!!!! There's probably some US public access channel show somewhere where two fat blokes review "adult" videos and give them "Bush" and "Gore" ratings!!!!! <i>"Nymphoid Mutants: it's got lots of Bush *and* lots of Gore!!!"</i> Mind you, at least the two names will help US voters remember about Monica Lewinsky and US foreign policy!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!! Now here's a site about one of presidential hopefuls, called "<a href="http://www.sonofbush.com/"><b>Son of Bush</b></a>", with the sub heading "Loser like his Father?" Hmm... I wonder who this person is going to vote in the elections
