U-no, I once had a go a this <a href="http://gnutella.wego.com/"><b>Gnutella</b></a> thingy, and tried to find that classic pop song  "<b>Grandad</b>" by <b>Clive Dunn</b> in Mpeggy format!!!!!!! It was a load of unuseable shit!!!!!!!!!!! It spent forever contacting other computers and reporting back their directories!!!!! And most of them were empty because nearly everyone was just interested in just downloading!!!!! I had trouble even finding mp3s, never mind anything that wasn't flipping <b>Limp Bizkit</b>!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>So it's no surprise to read that <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/zd/000922/08/gnutella-is-going">someone else is not-too-impressed with it</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
