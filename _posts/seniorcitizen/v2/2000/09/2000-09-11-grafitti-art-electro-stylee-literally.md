You know that crap car advert for some "customised" version of a car, and it's called Picasso!!!!! For some reason, there's a whole load of robots spraying Picasso-style art all over the car, then another one cleaning it off!!!!!<br/> <br/>What you might not know is that this is not just science fiction, but science fact!!!!!!!! There's now a robot which can <a href="http://www.appliedautonomy.com/gw.html">do spray can art</a>!!!!!!! Which is really good, because it means if you're wanting to put your latest artist creation on a New York subway train, then  you can program this robot to jump on a plane, then go round to a subway, then  paint the completed work on train!!!!! Which is much more convenient than actually doing it yourself, obviously.
