Nope!!!!! We're not talking about "<a href="http://news6.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid%5F884000/884732.stm">Nasty Nick</a>" or "<a href="http://news6.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_907000/907769.stm">Crappy Craig</a>" here!!!! In <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/article_print/0,1153,18191,00.html">this interesting article</a>, it's being suggested that all those big corporations that use the NetWeb to find out what we buy, when we go to the loo, etc will in turn be watched by website led consumer groups led by us!!!!! The only thing is- if we're spying on them and they're spying on us, that means when you spy on someone, then all you're going to see them doing is spying!!!! Which is a bit boring, really!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
