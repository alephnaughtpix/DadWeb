As I said above, apparently the sort of stuff I was doing in Senior Citizen is now known as a "Weblog"!!! Which is a really good name, because even if your weblog is crap, then the name "weblog" is still very appropriate!!!! There's now a few dedicated weblog generator sites, the king of which hosts this very site wot you are reading!!!!! It's called "<a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><b>Blogger</b></a>"!!!! Which sounds even more lavatorial if you ask me!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>If someone were to shut Blogger down, wouldn't that make them a "Blog-Stopper"?!?!?! (Right, Paul?!?!?!)
