As you have probably guessed, even if you are one of those ironic twats!!!!! The 70s is getting "played out" in nostalgic terms!!!!! There's stuff like the BBC's "<b>I Love the 70s</b>" which grimly extracts all the "wacky" stuff from a year per episode, making it a bit like the 70s nostalgia equivalent of an empty toothpaste tube being rolled up to extract the last drops of nostalgic funky toothpaste!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I bet you can guess what's happening next!!!!!! Yes, it'll be the 80s coming back into fashion and being the "decade that taste forgot" this time around!!!!!! Which is jolly funny, because in the 80s, they said that the 70s was the "decade that taste forgot"!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So, no doubt you'll be ready to withstand all those people who are about to pretend that they always liked Classix Nouveaux and Latin Quarter!!!!! But just in case you're asked an awkward question about the 80s, here's a <a href="http://www.80s.com/">helpful 80s trivia webbysite</a>!!!!!!! And here's <a href="http://www.yesterdayland.com/">another one</a>!!!!! OK, they're both a bit US-biased, but then again these days, but then again UK folks don't appear to mind!!!!! Even the lemmings over here don't jump off the cliffs, but take a plane to New York and jump off the Statue of Liberty instead!!!!!!
