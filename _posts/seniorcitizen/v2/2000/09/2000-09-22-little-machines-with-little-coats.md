When you were little (or a "wee wean", as we say around these parts!!!!!!) were you forced to wear crappy plastic "macs" when it rained?!?!!! And I'm not talking about old Apple computers here!!!!!! In fact, they would be absolutely no use!!!!!! If it rains, you're hardly going to stick a Mac SE-30 on your "dome" and expect it to protect you from the elements!!!!!! That would be really thick!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Woops, where was I!??!?!?! Anyway!!!! If you've worn plastic raincoats when you were little, you might understand how these little thingies feel!!!!! I am of course talking about nanomachines, and the fact that they're now going to be made to wear little <a href="http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/0009.Wei.nanoparticles.html">plastic coats</a>!!!!!! The reason this is that appparently when nanomachines run around in the nuddy, they tend to stick together and that's not supposed to be a good thing!!!!!! Well I suppose we don't want too many baby nanomachines I suppose...
