Imagine if that completely unreadable "novel" <b>Watership Down</b> was set right next to a nuclear reprocessing plant!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, this extraordinary lupine creature would fit right in!!!!!!!! That's because it's a <a href="http://www.ekac.org/gfpbunny.html"><b>Fluorescent Bunny</b></a>!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Apparently this is supposed to be some sort of "art" statment on genetic modification!!!!!!!!!!!! Which can be a bit pants, if you ask me!!!!!!!! I mean, what if some parents decide to put, as an "ironic" art statement, the words <i>"You're a dolt!!!!!!!"</i> on their kids forehead?!?!?!?!?! He'd have to go around wearing a picture frame around his head- or people would punch him in the face!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Dunno about you, but this might possibly have an effect on his personality as mature adult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>(Wot do you mean <i>"Aren't lupines a <a href="http://www.montypython.net/scripts/dennis2.php3">type of flower</a>!?!?!?!"</i>!!!!!!!!!!)
