After reading tonz of guffola written by various webhedz about how tha megamighty NetWeb is going to make changes to our craniums and make our society a mirror image of a San Francisco coffee bar wonderland, it's a nice to read an article about something a bit more practical in terms of new technologies!!!!!!!!! Like remote controls 4 tha tellybox!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Now, there was I time when I was less impressed with these objects, you know!!!!!!!!! Especially in the 70s, when people would make me sit down in front of their tellyboxes, fiddle around with their remotes, and say: <i>"Oh look!!! The tellys changing channels by itself!!!!!! How is it doing that??!?!?!"</i>!!!!! And I would say: <i>"Your TV is possessed by poltergeists!!!!!!!! Either that or it's the great big plastic brick-sized control thingy you're currently fiddling around with, which is connected to the tellybox by a whooping great big long wire!!!!!!!!"</i> They usually weren't "best pleased"!!!!!! Especially when I "exorcised" their tellyboxes by disconnecting the "remote", and added: <i>"It appears to be back to normal now!!!! It must have been a poltergiest after all!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!! <br/> <br/>So- it's a bit better now!!!!!! But now there's a different prob with remotes- remembering where you left the flippin' thing!!!!!!!!! It's even worse if you have seperate "doo-flickers" for tha tellybox, videogram, gramophone, wireless, and microwavey!!!!!! I wouldn't want to subject the neighbours to a blast of gool ol' <b><a href="http://www.wu-tang.net/">Wu Tang</a></b>, and find instead I've set the microwavey to boil my <a href="http://www.sterlingtimes.co.uk/ovaltine.htm">Ovaltine</a>!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, this spiffy article tells all about how all the "doin's" of the "doofer" might be integrated in a <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/rcfoc/column000925.htm">digital watch or a cellphone</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Apparently a lot of this stuff hinges around a technology called <b>Bluetooth</b>- tho wot <a href="hhttp://www.ubl.com/ubl_artist.asp?artistid=128274&amp;p_id=P+++100448">Shane MacGowan</a> of <a href="http://www.pogues.com/">The Pogues</a> has to do with protocols describing wireless cross-communication between consumer appliances is anyone's guess!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Only prob- how are you going to fit all those buttons on a mobile phone pad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
