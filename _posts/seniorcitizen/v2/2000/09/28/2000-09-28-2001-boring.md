Now this is an interesting film reviews site!!!!!!!!! None of the usual pseudy review stuff about what the placement of a coffee cup in a particular scene means about the empty materialistic Western capitalist system, or whatever it is they talk about these days!!!!!!! Nope, in <a href="http://www.freakytrigger.com/films.html">I Hate Films</a>, you get concise reviews about why <b>Taxi Driver</b> was crap because the taxi drive in question didn't keep his eyes on the road!!!!!! Or why the <b>Sixth Sense</b> was a load of rubbish because the "twist" was pretty obvious in the first place!!!!!!!!! Mind you, I especially like the review of <b>The Seventh Seal</b>, but I don't think I'll spoil that one for you!!!!
