We mentioned about a certain FSF members opinion of <a href="#784197">where</a> the ownership of this digital publishing lark is going, but what do the open source people want to do instead?!?!? Well, here's a novel (!!!!!!!!!) idea!!!!!! A book- as open source!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>This one's probably going to be useful to computer workers- it's an <a href="http://linuxvc.com/Free_Software/Employee_Handbook/">Employee Handbook</a>!!!!!!! The idea is that companies can work together using the "open source" model to develop a common personnel policy, just like they work together to make the latest versh of GNU YACC Lisp Emacs, or something!!!!!!! Even more interestingly, the peeps here want to some to create an employee handbook generator proggy!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The length of coffee breaks agreed upon using open source?!?!?!?!?! Bet you didn't expect that one!!!!!!!
