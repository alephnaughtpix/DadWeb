Yep, there's now a <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/smt/bn/on/index.cfm?story=ON-20000829-000719-1849">trojan for the handheld Palmpilots</a>!!!! So wot, you might say!!!! But this one is interesting, because it mimics part of a program- and it appears that it was ripped off some code done by one of the coders behind the very same program!!!!!!!! He didn't spread, except to a couple of friends, one of whom then spread it through IRC!!!!!!!!! Woops!!!!!!!!!!!
