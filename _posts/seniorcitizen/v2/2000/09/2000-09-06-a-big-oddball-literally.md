You might have seen some famous person on telly and thought: "<i>What an oddball!!!</i>" Well, here's the astronomical equivalent!!!!!! And it's got"beads"!!!!! It's a star called "<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/star_mysterious000901.html"><b>He2-90</b></a>", which makes it sound like a cross between <b><a href="http://www.he-man.org/cartoons/">He-Man</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/tv/joe90.htm">Joe 90</a></b>!!!! Which is not too far from the truth as astronomers think it might actually be two stars, one of whom is a bloated red giant and the other a tiny white dwarf!!!!!!!!!!!
