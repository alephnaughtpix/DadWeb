Guess this gives a new meaning to the phrase "<i>code warrior</i>"!!!!! There's now an equivalent of Basic called "<a href="http://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq/"><b>Var'aq</b></a>"!!!! Yes, it's a programming language in <b>Klingon</b>, the language those funny people with lobster-like heads in Star Trek speak, which makes them sound like Spit The Dog!!!!!!!!!!!! There's even a development mailing list for it!!!! I expect <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Zone/4441/"><b>Worf</b></a> will be on it, arguing whether it's "honourable" to optimise the compiler code!!!!!!
