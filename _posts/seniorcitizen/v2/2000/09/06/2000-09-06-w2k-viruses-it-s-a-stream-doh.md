When you're in the country, and you see a little stream (or a "burn" as we call it up here!!!! Tho why the word "<i>burn</i>" should be associated with a moving mass of water is anyone's guess!!!!! Unless of course, someone poured some battery acid into it.) Ahem anyway!!! When you're looking at the stream, what you might not know is that it's indicative of a new generation of computer virii!!!!! The latest virus attacking Windows 2000 is <a href="http://www.net-security.org/text/articles/viruses/generation.shtml">a new type of virus which uses "streaming" technology</a>!!!!!!
