Well, I've finally worked out how to set this flippin' thing up!!!! Now I can publish all my webby stuffs on this wonderful new site!!!<br/> <br/><i>Explanation thingy:</i> I used to do a fabby webby magaziney called <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/"><b>Senior Citizen</b></a>!!!!! Then I stopped doing it because I didn't have too much time to add stuff, and it was a bother to constantly update the HTML and stuffs!!!!<br/> <br/>But in the time since I "rested" <b>Senior Citizen</b>, suddenly the sort of thing my weekly maggy did has suddenly become "hip"!!!! It's now called a <i>weblog</i>!!!!!! Well I never!!!!! And there's been a couple of websites which cater to this sort of thing- which is jolly lucky, as it means less work for me!!!!!!!!!! And given that I've still been posting my wacky linx to all my friends, and they've been saying <i>"Why don't you just resurrect <b>Senior Citizen</b>, you silly old man!!!!"</i>, I thought "Why not!!!!!!!"... And you can bet my friends will regret the day they ever opened their mouths!!!!!!!!!!! But that's another story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, enough craptalk- here's some more craptalk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
