Some farmer in Nicaragua found some bones, and of course, he thought they were of the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/content/today/docs/007388.htm">infamous Chupacabra</a> blood-sucking animal thingy!!!! After all, <i>"It's teeth were rose-colored. It reared up on its hind legs and sucked the blood from at least 120 sheep.''</i>, which shows you can tell a lot from a skeleton, can't you?!??!?!?! <br/> <br/>Unfortunately, some university folks don't think so!!!! <i>"It's a dog, without any room for doubt. It's an ordinary female dog. All our investigations didn't show any anomaly. It's a dog.''</i>
