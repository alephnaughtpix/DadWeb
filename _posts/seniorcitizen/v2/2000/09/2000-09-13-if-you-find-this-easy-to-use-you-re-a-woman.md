U-no... (!!!!) After using loads of operating systems, (Coming to the conclusion that Windows is without doubt the biggest load of crap ever assembled in one place!!!!!) I've been surf-trolling tha megamighty W3 for loadsa infs about WIMPs, by which of course I mean the GUI, not the idiots from Big Brother!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>One interesting thingy I found was this "essay" called <a href="http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/06-01/dilger.html"><b>The Ideology of Ease</b></a> by the wonderfully named <b>Bradley Dilger</b>!!!!!!!!!! It starts off by noting the probs various computer students had FTPing and copying files to a floppy!!!!!! They're computer students forr flips sake, they should be learning these things!!!!!!!!!!! It's like trying to learn to drive without knowing what that big circular thing is on the dashboard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The other funny thing is the surprising assertion that the concept of ease of use is wimmen's stuff!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"Women are expected to identify with ease; men are expected either not to need it or to use it in passing on their way to superior ability. I believe ease is closely connected to the identification of masculinity with mastery and power."</div> <br/> <br/>I'll certainly remember that one next time I find I've spontaneously re-assigned my gender as a direct result of interaction with a graphical user interface!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
