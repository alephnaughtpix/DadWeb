Remember the old days when they taught you history?!?!?!? Well, if you do, how many times did you hear about an event, then the teacher says: <i>"Of course, it was all ripped off <b>Monty Python</b>!!!!!"</i>!??!?!?! <br/> <br/>Well, maybe not very often!!!!!!! But Terry Jones of the Python dudes apparently <a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/08/20/stirevnws02006.html">thinks so</a>!!!!!! And he also manages to summarise his recent "Gladiators" documentary in a nice easy-to-read article, so we don't have to bother watching the bloody thing on TV again!!!!!
