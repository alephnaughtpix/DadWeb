Those lucky colonials!!!!!! Why, only 12 years after us "limeys" jumped about in fields to "acid house" and wore garish baggy clothing, prompting some people to call it a "Second Summer of Love", folks in the US are jumping about in fields to "acid house" and wearing garish baggy clothing, prompting some people to call it a "Second Summer of Love"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And just like in 1988 in the UK, there's tons of <a href="http://www.newswatch.org/August2000%20stories/The%20Summer%20of%20MDMA%20082900.htm">"drugs menace" type stories</a> in the mainstream media!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I hate to think what happens when Big Beat hits the US in 2011!!!!!!!!! They'll have to bring Fatboy Slim over in a zimmer-frame by then!!!!!!!!!!!
