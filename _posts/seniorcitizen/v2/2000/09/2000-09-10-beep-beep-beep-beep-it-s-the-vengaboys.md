There has a been a major-change at SDHQ whilst SC got "<a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v2/#Whydoyoudothis">rested</a>"!!! I've got a mobile phone!!!!!! Yes, I got it as my social life amongst the old dears has expanded somewhat of late!!!!! I also got it to really annoy people on the buses by going into <i>"HELLLOOOOO!!!!!!! [pause] I'M ON THE BUUUS!!!! etc."</i>  But an even better way to annoy those young whippersnappers  would be to have a really nauseating mobile phone ring!!!!!! Well, you can program tunes on the thingies these days, so why not program in something from The Vengaboys or Ace of Base!??!! You can find out at this interesting webbysitey called "<a href="http://www.mobileedge.co.uk/"><b>Mobile edge</b></a>"!!!!!!!!!
