U-no, in ye olde days, you used to get de-classified documents in the form of a crappy photocopy with various bits blanked out by big black marker pens to "protect the innocent", or whatever crap excuse they used at the time!!!!!!!! So, when a US goverment decided to release a report where the names has to be censored out, they obviously thought it would be "cool" and "hip" to do something similar!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Only one prob- they released it in Adobe PDF format, and did the "blanking out" by putting "blank" squares on the names!!!!!!!!!!! So, all you needed to do was to edit the PDF file to remove the "blanks", and <a href="http://cryptome.org/carnivore-mask.htm">there were the names</a>!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Bit dim, huh?!?!?!? But then this is the US government we're talking about here!!!!!!!!!!
