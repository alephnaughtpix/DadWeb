You might have noticed that certain dead-tree-media (!!!!) folks have noticed that tha megamighty NetWeb Inpho-way hi-pipe has had an <a href="archives/2000_09_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#811146">effect on language</a>!!!!! Well, that realisation has finally hit Scotland's favourite grumpy slaphead, <b>Tom Brown</b>- columnist for the increasingly desperate Scottish tabloid the <b><a href="http://www.record-mail.co.uk/">Daily Record</a></b>!!!!!<br/> <br/>Presumably since the paper's moved into that swish new building on Anderston Quay, apparently Mr Brown's been getting into the pleasures of email!!! In his column today, he notes how "rude" it is, because it doesn't start with "Dear sir..." or end with "yours sincerely"!!!! He's also noticed that some people abbreviate words!!!! Apparently "lol" means "Laugh Out Loud"!!!!! Well I never!!!! He also threatens to answer any nasty emails sent to him with the reply: <i>"B*****s 2 U!"</i> (Well, that's what it says here!!!!!!!) <br/> <br/>You might notice that there's no weblink to the online webby version of his column- well, look we tried, but the Record's website is even more useless than the actual "newspaper"!!!!! We went along to <a href="http://www.record-mail.co.uk/shtml/TOM_BROWN_PAGE/index.shtml">Tom Brown's column</a> (Ooh-errrr!!!!!!!!) which is helpfully titled <i>"Untitled Document"</i>, and it's basically full of weeks old stuff!!!!!!!! In fact, it's dates from the time when his <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/media.cfm?id=TS00131248&amp;d=Features&amp;c=media&amp;s=0">former editor</a> wanted to give the give the government a good kicking!!!!! So you get an amusing rant where he claims to be an "old Labour supporter"!!!!! (Funny, I see no mention of when he was editor of the Scottish Daily Express, back when they still supported the Conservative party!!!!!!!) <br/> <br/>Even more amusingly, he writes later: <i>"Why hasn't there been a <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=TS00141189&amp;d=News&amp;c=front&amp;s=1">national outcry</a> about the price of petrol?"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
