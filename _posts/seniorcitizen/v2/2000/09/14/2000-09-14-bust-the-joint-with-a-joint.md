What with militant protests happening every place (Even in our own <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=TS00141189&amp;d=News&amp;c=front&amp;s=1">little ol' island</a>!!!) the average protester is going to have to be a bit smarter to stand out!!!!! <br/> <br/>So expect more stunts like this one!!!!! A load of people called The Australian Cannabis Law Reform Movement, who are in favour of the law being a bit easier on "special" cigarettes, are intending to disrupt a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, Australia- by battering down the door with a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/breaking/0009/12/A60900-2000Sep12.shtml">battering ram shaped like a big "Camberwell Carrot"</a>!!!!!!!!!!! A spokesman says: <i>"The Drug War is the pointy end of globalisation"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!
