U-no, when I was studying the gentle art of computer science at Uni (back when Unis were unis, and not former High Street toilets with the word "uni" stuck on them!!!!!) Oops, there I go being my wacky off-the-wall self again!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway- what we used to do at Uni was change the Mac system, so that it played funny samples when you did things!!!!! For example, set the keylcick to emit a gunshot FX, then an explosion for the Return key!!!!!! In fact, some of the more enterprising peeps (ie me!!!!!!) recorded our own samples!!!! When people did something wrong on my special system, they would hear an angry person saying: <i>"You complete and utter dolt!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>How much easier our job would have been if this CD was around!!!! From those delightful chaps at <b><a href="http://www.rhino.com/">Rhino</a></b>, who have brightened many a day with their re-release of the entire <b>Monkees</b> back catalogue, have come up with another winner!!!!!!! "<b><a href="http://www.rhino.com/features/79866p.html">Crash! Bang! Boom! The Best of WB Sound FX</a></b>"!!!!!!! Now your loony system can have Looney Toons sound FX!!!!!!!!!
