What on earth is <b>Cosplay</b>?!?!?!?!?!?! I just saw this word the other day, and found loads of websites connected with it, and I still don't know what it is!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Apparently it has something to do with <b>Anime</b> and wearing <a href="http://www.picubed.com/alisachan/index.htm">costumes</a> wot are based on Anime characters, and the people involved <a href="http://www.geocities.com/agsma/wayne/cosplay.htm">go to sci-fi stylee conventions</a> a lot, but that's about as far as I can comprehend of it, because no-where in their websites does anyone actually explain wot Cosplay actually is!!!!!!! Even tho there's <a href="http://nav.webring.yahoo.com/hub?ring=cosp&amp;list">tons</a> of <a href="http://search.webring.yahoo.com/search?p=Cosplay&amp;SearchType=All&amp;rs=cgcos&amp;ring=cgcos&amp;r=Entertainment_%26_Arts%2FComics_and_Animation%2FAnime%2FCosplay%2F&amp;Method=and&amp;RingDesc=on&amp;Keywords=on">websites</a> devoted to this enigmatic cause!!!!!! <br/> <br/>There's even <a href="http://nav.webring.yahoo.com/hub?ring=cgcos&amp;list"><b>CG Cosplay</b></a>, which given my current lack of knowledge on the subject makes about as much sense as "CG Ballroom Dancing"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
