How often have you passed McDonalds or Burger King and thought <i>"I wonder if there's an equivalent of these fast food retailers for atomic particles?!?!?!??!"</i>!!??!?!?! <br/> <br/>Well, maybe not!!!!! But only because it wouldn't be called "McDonalds" or "Burger King", it would be called "Higgs"!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>U C, (!!!!) it's this special type of "quark" thingy called a "boson"!!!! This particular type is called a "Higgs" boson, named after some dude called Higgs, presumably!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>What is does, according to scientest bods, is that there's squillions of them all about, too small to be seen, and they cause "drag" on the bigger atommic particles, which shows up as "mass"!!!! In other words, they slow down atomic matter, and make them put on weight, just like your average junk-food "boutique"!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, that's the theory anyway!!!!! And some scientest think they might have found <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_913000/913637.stm">actual evidence of it's existance</a>!!!! Apparently it's a bit "plump" itself- according to a scientest in this webby page: <i>"We all hope that what we are seeing is the Higgs on the horizon"</i>!!!!!!!!!!! Now that's what I call "big-boned"!!!!!!!!!!!!
