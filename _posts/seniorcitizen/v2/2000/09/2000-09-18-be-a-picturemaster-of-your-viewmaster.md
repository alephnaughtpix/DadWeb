Remember <b>ViewMaster</b>!??!?!?!? You know!!!!! That funny red plastic "binoculars" type thing with a circular selection of slides, and you looked into the contraption, and it allegedly shows the slides in "3D"!!!!!!! Then you flip some springy switch and it moves onto the next "slide"!!!!!!<br/> <br/>OK then, so you don't know what the four fruit marmalade I'm gabbling on about!!!!!!!!! But if by some microscopic chance you do, then you might be interested in this!!!!! The dudes who made ViewMaster are still around- and now they're letting you make <a href="http://www.customviewmaster.com/">custom slides</a> from your own piccies!!!!!!! Tho I think they might draw the line at some of the piccies I might supply them!!!!!!!! Which is a shame, as I'd really like to send some ViewMaster slides to certain <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/churchhall/songs/lyrics_can_you.shtml">Songs of Praise</a></b> presenters!!!!!!!!!!
