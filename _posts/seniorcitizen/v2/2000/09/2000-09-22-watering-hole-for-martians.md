The brainy boffins have discovered what appears 2 B a <i>"<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/mars_ice_000920.html">huge underground ice reservoir</a>"</i> near the surface at one bit of <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/mars_photos_000526.html">Valles Marineris</a>. (Which makes the Grand Canyon look like a piddling little hole in the ground!!!!!!!) <br/> <br/>I bet when most astronomoners heard this, they exclaimed: <i>"'Water' surprise!!!!!!!"</i> (Doh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/><i>(Thanks to the very nice <a href="http://bitek.cjb.net/">Bitek Processor</a> for putting us onto this one...)</i>
