Now this is amusing!!!!! Since about 1997, you've been able to embed hyperlinks and image URLs into MS Word documents!!! Only thing is, when you're viewing this doc and it requests an image off that NetWeb, the web server can find out server info about you!!! And they've <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/00/08/31/000831hnwebbug.xml">only just found this out</a>!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Even better than that, according to the <a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/advisories/advWordBugs.html">report</a> which took almost 3 years to find this, Word also can send and receive <b>cookies</b>, which would make it even easier for tracking peeps!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I wonder how long it will be before that bloody annoying animated paperclip in Word will start flying down whilst you're reading a doc and emote: <i>"It looks as though you are being tracked!!!! How may I be of assistance?!?!?!?"</i>. Then you tell him/her/it!!!!!! And he/she/it says: <i>"I'm sorry, I do not have the phrase <b>'F$&amp;^ OFF!!!'</b> in my dictionary!!!!!!!!"</i>
