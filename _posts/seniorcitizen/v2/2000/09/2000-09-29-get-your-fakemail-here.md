If you go to <a href="http://www.imailnow.com/main.htm">this page</a>, you get this blurb:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Send your internet e-mail now! No accounts, no logins, no passwords! Just fill in the form below and press the SEND IT button. </div> <br/> <br/>... And then a form, where you can fill out the destination email addr and message, as well, as the source email addr!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So, in other words, you can send fakemail from this form!!!!!!! And there's no checks on it!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Altogether now: <b>What a bunch of class A-1 divvies</b>!!!!!!!!!
