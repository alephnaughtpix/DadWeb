You know something's become popular when the people who were first involved start complaining that it isn't as good as it used to be!!!!!!!! Here's an (unintentionally) amusing thingy called <b><a href="http://www.nobody-knows-anything.com/websuck.html">"Why Web Journals Suck"</a></b>- by a weblog writer!!!!!!! And as you'd expect, it's really a bit of angst about the great unwashed crashing the weblog party!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, all I can say is I did weblogs before they were hip, and even then I "failed" all the "criteria" set by this "essay"- which is just as well, as that's what made <b>Senior Citizen</b> a really great mag, if I may humbly say so!!!!!!!!! At least it wasn't some whiny self-indulgent "aspirational" waste of space like most weblog/diaries I've seen!!!!!!!!!!!! Pah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
