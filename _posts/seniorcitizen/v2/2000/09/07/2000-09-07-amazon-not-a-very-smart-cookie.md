Well, if you were a big dotcommie in debt, and you used cookies to track your registered users when they bought stuffs, then you might be tempted to do something a little "off", wouldn't you?!!??!?! Only prob is- if you've got a lot of registered users, some of them are going to notice something screwy sooner or later!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Which appears to be exactly what's happening to Amazon!!!! Some users have bought stuff form them, and come back the same day to find that the price of the thing they've bought has just gone up!!!!!!! Yep, you guessed it, when the Amazon webserver receives the cookie of a regular user, it ups the price a little bit!!!!!!!!! Which is a nice little earner, I suppose- until the regular customers find out!!!! <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/13069.html">Which they have</a>!!!!! Woops!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Still, if you have a dial-up account, and switch off the cookies, you can still get cheaper prices!!!! Just put the stuff into the shopping cart, and then switch cookies back on, and log in!!!! Then they can't increase the prices, or it'll be really obvious!!!!!!!
