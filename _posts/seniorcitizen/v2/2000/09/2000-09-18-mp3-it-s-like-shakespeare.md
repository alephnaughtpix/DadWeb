Nope!!!!! I'm not being my usual wacky self here!!!!! Some person in this article is comparing the two thingies!!!!! <br/> <br/>Apparently the amount of bizzare bootlegs and pirated stuffs being traded on Napster/Freenet/Gnutella/PloppyTrader is starting to get a bit like the olden days, round about ol' Shake's time, when people used to rip off each others printed work and mess around with it!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>To be honest, it's not too much of a surprise- I mean, we've already had MP3s, like the Slim-Shady/Enya Remix, and there's even the suspciuous "remix" of Aqua's "Barbie Girl" I mentioned way back an old 1998 Senior Citizen!!!!!! But now you can record any crap punk band really badly, label it as a "Nirvana Bootleg (rare)", and peeps will download it like mad!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The bloke in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/asap/00/1002/032.htm">this article</a> suggests "fixing" the official versh of a song by recording it onto a CD!!!! (Or put it on the band's official website, surely?!?!?!?!)
