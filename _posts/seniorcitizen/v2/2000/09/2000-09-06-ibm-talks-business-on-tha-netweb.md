Given that they've been around since "nineteen-canteen" you would have thought IBM would have has no problem talking business!!!!! But apparently they're just starrting to work out how to talk business- on tha NetWeb, that is!!!! They're teaming up with some company to do <a href="http://www.techserver.com/noframes/story/0,2294,500247221-500367379-502173944-0,00.html"><b>UDDI</b></a>, which is apparently some HTTP-like way to allow businesses on tha info-highway-pipe to provide info about themselves- a bit like all those companies who do a crap 2 page website giving out their address, phone and the usual <i>"the sun shines out our bottom"</i> type bumf!!! Except that UDDI is presumably a bit better.
