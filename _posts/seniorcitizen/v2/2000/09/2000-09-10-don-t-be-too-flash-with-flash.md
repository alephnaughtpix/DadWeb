Guess wot!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently they've found out that a lot of w3surfers are <a href="http://www.digitalmass.com/columns/internet/0906.html">getting a little cheesed off</a> at loading ginormus Flash jobbies when they goto a webby site!!! You know that ones: they flash some logo from a company, and then they fade in and out words like "innovation" and  "creation" and loadsa other "-ion" words!!!!!! And you have to wait a minute for it to load!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Mind you, if <a href="http://www.dack.com/web/flash_evil.html">try and say it</a>, you run the risk of getting thousands of arty designers mailing you back, saying "phew crickey grandad, you're so square!!!!"!!!!!!!! Harumph!!!!!!!!!!!!
