Apparently this is what I was in a <b><a href="http://passionup.com/fun/fun300.htm">previous life!!!!!!</a></b> According this interesting website anyway!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">In your past incarnation you were <b>Male</b>.You were born at or near Greece approximately on <b>550</b>.<br/> <br/>Your profession was <b>monk, bee-keeper, lone gunman.</b> <br/> <br/>In your previous life:<br/><b>You lived your previous life like a gypsy, always craving something new, fascinated by change. You loved art, music, and cooking so much that you probably enjoy these things in this life as well. Like then, you live for the fun times.</b> <br/> <br/>Lessons of your past life and how they affect the present:<br/><b>You learned much about pain and humility in your previous life. In this life, you understand how important it is to help and have mercy for others. Never let an opportunity to help someone pass you by. It will result in spiritual growth and will earn you the admiration of others.</b></div> <br/> <br/>So next time you see a humble bohemian upwardly-mobile Greek assassin, wait till he's 1400 years old- that'll be me!!!!!!!!!!
