Well, you might remember Mr John "<a href="#874654">Bullshit Buzzer</a>" Beattie from yesterday... And here's another flippant columnist from the <b><a href="http://theherald.co.uk/">Herald</a></b>!!!!!!!! He seems to be taking the "piddle" of out the <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/laing/archive/20-9-19100-20-4-57.html">issues surround the recent UK fuel blockade</a> I think!!!!!! In this version, it's a "booze blockade"....
