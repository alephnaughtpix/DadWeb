Yes, I am of course, talking about the very wonderful <b>Bill Grundy</b>, who interviewed a bunch of unknown young sprites by the name of the <b>Sex Pistols</b> live on TV at teatime!!!!!!!!! He asked them to <i>"say something outrageous"</i> and they called him a <i>"F@£%ing rotter"</i>!!!!!!! It caused a bit of a rumble down South, I can tell you!!!!! I mean, young people using a word like "rotter"?!??!?! Crikey!!!! If I were in their shoes I would have called him a <i>"f@£%ing dolt-ish c@#t"</i>!!!!!!!!!! That would have been much more acceptable!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!!! You can read the transcript, and listen to a realaudio of the interview that first introduced the world to the Sex Pistols unique talents, and cost Mr Grundy his job!!!!! Thanks to this jolly nice <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/MusicStar/6282/pistols/interview/grundy.html#english">website</a> from Japan!!!! <br/> <br/>Essential stuff- unless you're a "f@£%ing rotter" of course!!!!!!!!!
