Phew!!!!! After a rant like that, there is one thing that is guaranteed to calm my nerves!!!!! <br/><br/>I am of course talking about a good old blast of UK techno hardcore circa 89-94!!!!!! There were tonz (!!!!) of these funky chunes being made, some never getting even to a proper radio, but a lot getting into the charts and prompting the usual "pop is dead" type nonsense from boring gits!!!!!! Most of them are now deleted, which makes it really hard to get hold of!!!!! I mean, you can't just go down to your local HMV and say <i>"Have you got that spiffy gramophone by <b>Red Alert and Mike Slammer</b>, my good man?!?!?!???"</i>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>But yet again, tha W3 doth save the day(-ee!!!) This fabby site called <a href="http://www.future-primitive.co.uk/"><b>Future Primitive</b></a> has tons of links to various lost classics, including the very wonderful "<b><a href="http://www.gowingo.com/web/futprim001/jumpin_and_pumpin/027.mp3">Stakker Humanoid</a></b>", and lots of proto-jungle hardcore by the likes of <b>4-Hero</b>!!!!<br/><br/>So you can imagine I'm a little pleased!!!!!!!!
