Well, it may not be fashoionable or "hip" to say this, but... Isn't the state of music in the UK a load of complete crap?!?!??!?! I mean, loadsa sheep robot type people listening to absolute garbage just to "fit in"!!!!!! And it sells, and takes up valuable media space!!!!!!! And people think it's really cool!!!!! And anything non-trendy gets slagged off mercilessly by people who wouldn't know good music if it hit them on the head with a baseball bat marked: <i>"This is really good music!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yep, all in all, the UK indie scene has completely gone downhill in the past few years!!!!! While proper pop music has forged ahead in the past few years (barring the odd shite Pete Waterman produced act...), indie has generally given up being creative and gone right up it's collective anus!!!!!!! I mean, flipping <b>Coldplay</b>!!!!! What's the big deal about that crappy single "Yellow"!??!?! It sounds like a bad 1991 outtake from an ill-advised Cocteau Twins tribute band!!!! And the vid- a bloke on a beach, in an anorack!!!!!!!!!!!! And what about the flippin' <b>Stereophonics</b>?!?!?! Things have come to a pretty pass when they think it's pretty "revolutionary" to start ripping off Neil Young instead of bloody Del Amitri!!!!!!! And <b>Gomez</b> has the cheek to slag off kick-ass modern R'n'B like <b>Missy Elliot</b> because they make records that are not stuck in some idealised 60s Soul Disneyland!!!!!! And as for all this huffing and puffing about <b>Slipknot</b> being "rebellious", well it only took two fresh-faced pop brats by the name of <b>Daphne &amp; Celeste</b> to completely upstage their act at the Reading festy!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Fume, fume!!!! Er, where was I!?!?!?!?!?! Oh yes, the only prob is that if you're fed up of holier-than-thou indie spod mags, then usually the only other choice has been flippin' terrible pop mags written by peeps marginally less intelligent than Barbie dolls!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Until tha megamighty W3 NetWeb inphopipeway came along tho!!!!!! Check out <a href="http://www.freakytrigger.co.uk/nylpm/"><b>New York, London, Paris, Munich</b></a>... Yep, everything they're talking about is pop music!!!!!!! And they're not too bad at it either!!!!!!
