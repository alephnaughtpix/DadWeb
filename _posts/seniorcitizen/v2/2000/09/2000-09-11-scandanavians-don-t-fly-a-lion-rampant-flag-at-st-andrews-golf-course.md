Why!??!?! Well, apparently Lord Lyon will get cross!!!!!!! Because, erm, apparently, you might be mistaken for Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire!!!!!! Thus you might be destroying ancient Scottish culture!!!!!! At least, that's the reason according to Lord Lyon, reported in a rather <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/letters/archive/7-9-19100-21-2-30.html#RTFToC2">amusing letter</a> about a Scandanavian golf trip to St Andrews, published in last week's <b><a "="" href="&lt;a href=" http:="" www.theherald.co.uk="">Glasgow Herald</a></b>, which is a really serious broadsheet newspaper, and still read by "well-to-do" people in Scotland, who talk complete crap from a bygone age!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"In order to illustrate the point, if every Tom, Dick, and Harry is going to turn up at the Aboyne Games with the <a href="http://www.kilpatrick-assoc.com/kilclan/lion.htm">lion rampant flag</a> on their cars, how are we able to know at a glance when the car of the Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire is appearing? In the same way, at the gathering, St Andrew's Cross is flown on the main flagstaff in the forenoon, but the moment the Lord Lieutenant arrives a trumpet call is sounded, the pipes play a failte, and the tressured lion rampant flag is raised. This is commonsense ceremonial as it has come down through the ages of Scottish law and history."</div> <br/> <br/>Parochial Scottish Lairds- don't you just love them?!?!?!?! I'm going get my battered old Mini up to St Andrews with loads of lion rampants on it, and if Lord Lyon throws a fit, I'll say: <i>"How dare you!!!!!!! I'm the Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire!!!!!!"</i>!!!!
