Looks like there's some hackers in the UK Fuel Protestors crowd!!!! Dis little webbysite got zapped by one of those new-fangled "hacktivist" peeps with his little <a href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/09/15/www.bobbybrowns.co.uk/">public address</a> on tha UK petrol tax "stramash"!!!!!<br/> <br/>Nice one!!!!!! But why like most hacked sites, is the web design so bloody awful!??!?!?!? OK, you might not have been able to upload any GFX, but surely in this day and age you can add some stylesheet directives, and use some more tasteful colours, instead of the flipping ST Degas Elite system colors used here!!!!!!!!!! I mean, this is 2000AD, for Cliff's sake!!!!!!!!
