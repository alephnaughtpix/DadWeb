I notice our esteemed publication fails to get mentioned in <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/standard.html">this article about UK based webloggers</a>!!!!!!!! Probably because we're not some bunch of "bohemian" type people plastering our egos over tha W3 I suspect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>As usual, you middle-class "feature" writers seem to miss the real story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
