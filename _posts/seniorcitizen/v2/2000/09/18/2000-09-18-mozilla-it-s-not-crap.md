Looks like that highly amusing <b><a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/07/31/">Suck</a></b> article which decided, in typical Suck-y unreadable fashion, that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/"><b>Mozilla</b></a> was "out", has encouraged more people to give it a go!!!!!!! I know it has in my case!!!!!!!! And the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">latest versh</a> is actually getting pretty useable, as well as having a lot of interesting XML-based backend technology which is blurring the differences between tha browsey-wowsey and tha compute OS!!!! (Which in the case of Windows is a definate boon!!!!) Looks like the official Mozilla has got definate potential- and you can even get a <a href="http://www.kmeleon.org/">not-so-big versh</a> of it for all you Linux propeller-heads!!!!<br/> <br/>And it looks like I'm not the only to notice it either- so has the person, who giving it <a href="http://www.linuxpower.org/display.php?id=196">a plug</a>- complete with big screenshots!!!!! Of course, you get the usual Slashdot-type moaning gits adding comments afterwards, but then you would expect that, wouldn't you!!!!!!!!!!
