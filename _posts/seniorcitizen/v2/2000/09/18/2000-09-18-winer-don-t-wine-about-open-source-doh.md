You know those funny computing and business trends magazines who seem to pounce on everything new like it's the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then say it's complete crap when it fails to live up to their expectations within 6 weeks!!!!!! It's happened before with Java, now it seems like it's "Open source is complete crap!!!!" season!!!!! <br/> <br/>There's been enough of them, that open source fan Dave Winer has taken it upon himself to write <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/15/whatIsOpenSource">a nice detailed article</a> about them, slagging them off!!!!<br/> <br/>A bloke called "Winer" slagging off whiners?!??! Wot next? A bloke called "Windows" slagging off Microsoft?!?!??!?!?!
