<div class="quote">I had (and still have) a dream that the web could be less of a television channel and more of an interactive sea of shared knowledge. I imagine it immersing us as a warm, friendly environment made of the things we and our friends have seen, heard, believe or have figured out. I would like it to bring our friends and colleagues closer, in that by working on this knowledge together we can come to better understandings. [...] The dream is that if everybody works from day to day using the web as their notebook, mailer and calendar, [...] then the scaling problems of teams and organizations could somehow be solved. </div> <br/> <br/>So!!!! Who's this far-sighted fellow who sees the likes of Blogger as a step towards global harmony!?!?!?!? Why, it's good ol' <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, every European's favourite three word answer to some US person who goes: <i>"We invented the web you limey assholes!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>. <br/> <br/>Of course he's not exactly saying even this mighty organ (Ooo-err missus!!!!! Oh crikey, vicar!!!! etc.) will bring about world harmony!!!!! But in this lecture thingy he does called "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/9510_Bush/Talk.html"><b>Hypertext and Our Collective Destiny</b></a>" he mentions that it goes someway to doing what this bloke called <b>Dr Vannevar Bush</b> was trying to do!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Er, hang on!!!! Isn't that former US Prez George Bush's dad or something!??!?!?!?!? Does that mean we're going to have to suffer a Presedential Campaign with Al Gore claiming he invented tha NetWeb, and George W claiming his grandaddy invented tha W3?!?!??!?!?!?
