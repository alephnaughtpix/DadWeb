Well, no doubt you're probably a bit sick of hearing record company execs saying they want to cut the balls off Napster users, and sell their children into slavery!!!!!!! So here instead is an old MTV hack, who has an interesting idea for MP3- format it!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Nope!!!!!!! He doesn't mean format the hard drive!!!!!!!! In fact, he's making a vaguely interesting argument about being able to stitch MP3 in a <a href="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$161">fashion not unlike a radio playlist</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So even on your MP3 player, you're going to get some idiot blathering all over the end of the song, just like a <a "="" href+"http:="" radio1="" www.bbc.co.uk="">BBC Radio 1 DJ</a>!!!!! Either that or pause for a bit and make some comment that they think is terribly clever and witty, and pause again for people to laugh heartily and worship the very ground they walk upon- just like MTV VJs!!!!!!
