Didn't quite expect to see this sentence opening a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/beattie/archive/15-8-19100-21-5-16.html">piece</a> in Scotland's oldest broadsheet newspaper, the <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/"><b>Glasgow Herald</b></a>!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"You should be allowed to press a "Bullshit Buzzer".  When a politician tells a porky, when a car manufacturer claims their lump of steel will make you braver or slightly larger in the nether regions, or at any other time you sense that garbage is being talked in the pursuance of corporate or individual self-interest."</div> <br/> <br/>Cripes!!!!! If that was the <a href="http://www.record-mail.co.uk/"><b>Daily Record</b></a>, it would be <i>"bulls**t"</i>, <i>"p*rky"</i> and <i>"n****r regions"</i>!!!!!!!!
