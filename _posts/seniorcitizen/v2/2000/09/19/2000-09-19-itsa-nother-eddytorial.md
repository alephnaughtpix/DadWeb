Well, this is the first post-submit-SC-to-loadsa-blog-portals issue, so let me say "greetings!!!!!!" to all the squillions of new readers!!!!!! You're probably wondering what the "fudge fancy" is going on!!!!!!! Well, good!!!!!! I like keeping you on your toes!!!!!!!! I'm not going to pre-digest this for you, intellectually speaking!!!!!!! And if you expect any intellectual regurgitation, then I'm afraid you're going to be a little disappointed!!!!!!!!! You've got some braincells in your noggin- flipping well use them!!!!!!!!!!!! Trouble with you young whippersnappers is that you don't learn to use the ol' grey matter!!!!!!!! Too busy watching flippin' "docusoaps" and listening to "Ibiza mixes"!!!!!!!!!! I remember when Ibiza was a decent place for dropout hippies!!!!!!!! In my day, you could get one "special" tablet, go to a "baelaric" club where young Mr Tong played stuff like "The Woodentops", and you could still have enough to get back to Cafe Del Mar and listen to some old Spanish bloke play hippy music!!!!! Now <i>that's</i> what I call a night out, my son!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Ahem!!!!! Where was I?!?!?!?! Oh yes!!!!! I'm going to be adding a FAQ answering loads of questions wot I just made up!!!!!! And then the redesign of SC will move onto "Phase II", where there will be a proper index to the site, and you can browse previous issues of SC at your leisure!!!!! Until then, here's the <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/">old site</a>!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Luckily, there's no phases beyond "Phase II"!!!!!!! If we got to "<a href="http://tilt.largo.fl.us/critic/mst3k/sskk096.html">Phase IV</a>", then we'd all turn into ants!!!!!!!!!!!! And then it would be really hard to edit SC wouldn't it?!?!??!?! Unless we got ant-sized computers!!!!!!! Which would be possible if people making computers hadn't been turned into ants, but if they had, then we'd really be in a pickle!!!! We'd have to re-start computer technology all over again!!!!!! It would be years until we get anywhere near the level of technology required to operate a weblog!!!!!! Which would mean that there would be a bit of a delay in updating Senior Citizen!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So, perhaps it just as well that the chances of this scenario happening are remote in the extreme!!!!!!!!!!!!
