If you want to really mess with the minds of "trendy" people with "media" glasses and not much hair, then point them to this product- because it's simultaneously "cool"- and "pants"!!!!!<br/> <br/>How is this possible?!?!?!?! Erm, well, it's "<b>cool pants</b>" ie <a href="http://asia.dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/technology/afp/article.html?s=asia/headlines/000803/technology/afp/Cool_pants__Japanese_underwear_tackles_groin_heat.html">refrigerated underwear</a>!!!!!!
