Never mind big rings, wot about small bots?!?!?!?! By which I of course mean <b>Nanobots</b>!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>You might remember that tortuous nanobots storyline in <b>Red Dwarf VII</b>!!!! Well, this lot of nanobots scientests know absolutely nothing about it- but they are big fans of Star Trek!!!!!! <i>"I was a dyed-in-the-wool Trekkie"</i> says one!!!!! So that's all right then!!!!! They're also into "2001: A Space Oddessy", even tho it's obviously out of date!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Rather annoyingly, the article in question is on this single page "edition" of something called <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge73.html"><b>Edge</b></a>, but no direct link to the article in question!!!!!!! Just search for the text <i>"Beyond 2001: HAL's Legacy for the Enterprise Generation"</i>.
