Yep, you've probably been seeing this one coming after we were talking about nanotechnology and <a href="archives/2000_09_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#811152">"internal" ID chips</a> last week!!!!!! So here it is!!!!!!<br/><br/>Move over, humans!!!!!!! Looks like the next hype is going to be "<b><a href="http://www.transhumanist.org/">transhumans</a></b>" and "<b>posthumans</b>"!!!!!!! The two terms of course referring to what humans will presumably be called in the post info-hiway-pipe nanobot revolution!!!! Apparently, <i>"some signs of transhumanity include bodily augmentation with implants, androgyny, asexual reproduction, and distributed identity"</i>, which sounds a bit like those peeps in that Gap advert if you ask me!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Ah!!!! This is just like the old days of the web, when people were going on about the internet turning the world into a global village where everyone just happened to act like burnt-out Californian hippies!!!!!! Talking of which, doesn't it all read a bit much like that dude <b>Terence McKenna</b> that those folks from <b>The Shamen</b> were hanging out with?!?!?! <br/><br/>Wot, do you mean: <i>"Who TF is TK?!?!?!?"</i>!!!!!!! Actually, he's been going around for some time... And if you thought that all those end-of-world people would be a bit quieter after the New Years celebrations passed off without the apocalypse spoiling things, you'd be wrong!!!!!!! Check this one out!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Apparently the pace at which life changes is accellerating so much that there it'll come to a "singularity" (as early as 2012!), where everything changes all the time in a really "psychedelic" fashion!!!!!!! You'll probably find yourself becoming "transhuman" or "posthuman" over a single lunchtime!!!!!! And if you don't watch out, and your brain will go foom!!!!!!<br/><br/>Answer!?!?!? Take lots of psychedelic drugs, apparently!!!!!!! And <a href="http://www.omroep.nl/ikon/technocalypse/MCKenna.htm">this interview with McKenna</a> gives you some helpful hints on the "organic" variety, which you can get next time you're on a trip (!!!!!!) down to your local Amazonian Rain Forest!!!!!!<br/><br/>Needless to say, the Transhuman folks are a more "respectable" bunch, and don't spend loads of time talking about the effects of various "special" fungi!!!!!!!!!
