You might heard of this "dark age" lark, which happened way back in the olden days when the Roman Empire went kaput!!!!!!!! But it might have been literally dark!!!!!! Or at least a little dimmer.<br/> <br/>Some scientest dude has found evidence that the beginning of the Dark Ages coincided with an apparent <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/r/000908/12/science-comet">meteorite strike</a> somewhere on the planet, which might have messed up the climate a tad!!!!<br/> <br/>And he found all this by looking at some tree rings!!! I hope he kept a "log" of the results!!!!!!!! (Doh!!!!!!!!!!)
