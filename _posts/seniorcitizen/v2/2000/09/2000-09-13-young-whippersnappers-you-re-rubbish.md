At least, you are according to this <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/laing/archive/13-9-19100-20-9-35.html">vaguely amusing article</a> in today's <b><a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/">Glasgow Herald</a></b>. Apparently the "wee weans" are too well behaved or something!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Frankly, my daughter's pals let the side down. They were a disgrace to their generation. They were so damned polite and pleasant and well-behaved. None of them fell over. They didn't shout and swear. Nothing was smashed. Not one fight broke out. They didn't get elephant's trunk. No-one disgraced themselves. In fact, they were perfect company. <br/> <br/>And that's why they ought to be ashamed of themselves. Whatever happened to the outrageous behaviour of youth? How are old geezers like us supposed to enjoy a party if we don't have their laddish antics to complain about? Don't they realise that they're depriving us oldies of the pleasure of being able to say things like: "For God's sake, turn that bloody music down. You can't hear yourself speak in here!" Or: "Put that funny cigarette out, my lad, and put it out now!" Or even: "That's it, I'm calling the police!" </div>
