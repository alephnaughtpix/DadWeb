You see that ad banner at the top of this page?!??!?!?! According to some boffin at a German technoconference, you didn't!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yep, this article describes the hilarious speech made by one <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/00/09/21/000921hnbannerads.xml?0926tucr"><b>Jason McCabe Calacanis</b></a>!!!!! Check these classics out!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"We standardized a failed concept. That's how stupid we are in the Internet industry"</div> <br/> <br/>Speak for yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been involved with tha NetWeb since ninteen-canteen, and I think banner ads are a failed concept!!!!!!!! Mind you I think <b>all</b> ads are a failed concept!!!!!!!! And I'm a bit of a brainbox as well.<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"We have to come up with a form of advertising on the Internet that's disruptive"</div> <br/> <br/>That's wot we all need!!!! I'm typing in some sonnet on tha inphopipeway highweb and halfway through the editor stops and trys to sell me shampoo!??!??!?!?! I think we've learned from those annoying pop-up ad pages, that peeps who surf da w3 do not like "disruptive" ads blocking their surfage!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>He also asks people to stop copying US sites and do more uniquely European ones: <br/> <br/><div class="quote">"Make <a href="http://www.lego.com">Lego</a>s, for God's sake"</div> <br/> <br/>!!!!!!! I think this last one explains a lot!!!!!!!!
