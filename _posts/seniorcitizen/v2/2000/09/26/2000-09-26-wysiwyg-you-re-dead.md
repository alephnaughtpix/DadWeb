Flippin' 'eck- I should have seen this one coming!!!!!! The warning signs were all there- I mean, <b>Chumbawumba</b> named their last album after it!!!!! So, it must have been on it's last legs!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I am of course talking about WSYIWYG!!!!!!! It's supposed to be dead, according to this little page!!!!!! Mind you, it is plugging some commercial softs!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Apparently structured documents using stuffs like XML are coming more to the fore, but the editors haven't been that much up to scratch!!!!!!! But this bunch are pushing <a href="http://www.conglomerate.org/docs/death_of_wysiwyg.html"><b>Conglomerate</b></a>, which is apparently like a "Word" of XML editors- but don't let that put you off!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Er, hang on- doesn't that make it a WYSIWIYG editor of non-WSYIWYG docfiles?!?!?!?!?!
