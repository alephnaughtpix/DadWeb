Seems like everyone's laying a log in public these days!!!!!!! I've been doing it for a long time now!!!!! However, not all public "doing" of logs is the same!!!!!<br/>U C (!!!!), there are some who do small little logs, (or "toaty wee wans", as we say around these parts!!!!!!) and others who do reallly big ones!!!!! There are also those who do their own logs, and those who recycle other peoples logs!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>I am of course talking about weblogs!!!!!!!! Why- what do you think I was talking about, then?!?!??!?!?!? Anyway, some person has noticed the burgeoning phenonenomenonemon that is w3Logz!!!!! And has wrote this <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html">spiffy little article</a> about it!!!!!<br/> <br/>Actually, I think I know how the 1st para could be read!!!!!! Euuurrrrggghhhh!!!!! Bllllleeeeuuuurrrrggghhhh!!!!! Yeeeeeuuuurrrggghhhh!!!!! Grrrrrooooooo!!!!! Spit!!!!!! Spit!!!!!! Yuk!!!!! Croak.
