My, aren't <b>Barenaked Ladies</b> a really really wacky band?!?!??! Not content with fooling people using their really "risque" name, they're now fooling peeps in Napster with their "goofy" MP3 antics!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Loads of people have been downloading what appeared to be new BNL traxxkz, (doesn't that sound like a railway entrance to a nuclear power station?!??!?!) only to find they cut off part way through for <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_64072.html">adverts for the new album</a>!!!!!!!!!! <i>"Although you thought you were downloading our new single, what you actually were downloading is an advertisement for our new album."</i> says one!!!!!<br/> <br/>Of course, you know wot this means!!!!!!!!! Some porno "kingpin" is going to use the same trick, and cut off a Barenaked Ladies MP3 halfway thru to advertise a porno website!!!!!! You can imagine it spreading to other groups as well!!!!!!!!! Bush and Hole watch out!!!!!!! Bet Courtney Love won't be too pleased with Napster if that happens!!!!!!!!!!!
