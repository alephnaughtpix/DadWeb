Interesting stat for you folks now!!!!! At <i>most</i>, no more than 75% of the webby pages I troll each day actually make it into Senior Citizen because of time commitments and stuff like that!!!!! In fact, sometimes on slow days, I often report on pages I trolled at least a couple of days ago!!!!!!!<br/><br/>But wot I did not know is that apparently I am practicising a rudimentary form of information technology selection techniques in order to acheive things such as: <i>"filtering information overload, effective reading, note-taking, analysis, synthesis and communicating effectively to others"</i>!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yes, there's some jolly new "management technique" technique called <b>Knowledge Management</b>, which is now also <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/km/dcrm_km_article.asp?id=477">being developed for individual peeps like us</a> in order to avoid "information overload" and gain "the skills or tools to keep up in the Knowledge Age" and other similar stuffs!!!!!! <br/><br/>Here's one hot tip from the article: apparently it's a good idea to be <i>"eating well and getting enough sleep"</i>!!!!!!!!!!! So, if your boss catches you asleep on the job (By which we mean your workplace!!!!!! And not "laying a cable" in the "lavvy", as some people might think!!!!!! Tho mind you, if your boss turns up in the "little room" and tries the latter, one could be perfectly justified in protecting one's modesty using the technique of blindfolding" one's employer- by chucking used toilet paper at him!!!!!!!) Ahem, anyway!!!! If he catches you asleep, you can explain to him that you were merely improving your Knowledge Management techniques- and then demand that he takes you to a good restaurant so you can "eat well"!!!!!!!!!
