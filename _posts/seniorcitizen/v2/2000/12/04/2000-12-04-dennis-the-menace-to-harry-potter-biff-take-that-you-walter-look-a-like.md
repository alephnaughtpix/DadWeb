Cripes!!!!! It's look like veteran kiddies komic <a href="http://www.beano.co.uk/"><b>The Beano</b></a> isn't just wowing them over in <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1415427">Japan</a>!!!!!! It looks as thought it's doing the busines over here as well!!!!!! Advance orders for the <b>Beano 2001 Annual</b> this Xmas have knocked the near-mythical <b>Harry Potter</b> <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=TS00202171&amp;d=News&amp;c=front&amp;s=3">off the best-seller lists</a>!!!!!!! <i>"You can always trust the Beano gang to make a menace of themselves"</i> said some bloke.
