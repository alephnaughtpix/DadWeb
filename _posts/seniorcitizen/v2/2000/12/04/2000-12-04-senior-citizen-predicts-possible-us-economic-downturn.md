Crikey!!!!!! It's been a bit of a dramatic time recently for tech stocks and e-business!!!!!!! Not only has there been loads of UK dotcoms (Usually run by loadsa young thrusting types who thought they were the business equivalent of "rock stars" or something!!!!!!!) falling by the wayside, but the tech industry in general has been seeing something of a big of a downturn, with a lot of people saying that it might be because the PC home market has reached saturation point!!!!!!!!! And it's even got through to this columnist bloke from <b>The Scotsman</b> by the name of <b>Bill Jamieson</b>, who is taking a break from recycling his <i>"The European Parliament is Satan!!!!!!!"</i> article every flipping week, to <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=TS00202166&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Fcolumnists%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=&amp;navlevel2=">cover these events</a>, noting that the high heid yin of Big Blue (By which we mean of course IBM, and not an "adult" video mail-order company as you may think!!!!!!) proclaimed that the PC is dead!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Which is jolly interesting, as we predicted something similar in an <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/10.html#297">old issue of SC in September 1998</a>!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Perhaps Bill Jamieson ought to be reading us instead of "Smarmy Right-Wing Think-Tank Monthly", or whatever it is he reads!!!!!!!!!!!
