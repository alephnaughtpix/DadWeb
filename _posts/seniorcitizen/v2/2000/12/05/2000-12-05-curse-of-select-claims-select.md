Hum... I reckon missed this one on Friday, because it has "Select" in the headline!!!!!!!! Anyway!!!! It looks like after we <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_11_12_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1353188">slagged off</a> <b>Select</b>, the not-very-good "music/lifestyle" monthly, it looks the EMAP Chaps have independently come to a similar conclusion!!!!!! And they've <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1050000/1050512.stm">shut it down</a>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>They give some extremely spurious reasoning for it shutting down as well:<br/><br/><div class="quote">Market conditions mean that the indie sector, which Select emphatically championed, has been completely absorbed into the mainstream, illustrated by the huge success of the magazine's core bands - Oasis, Blur and Radiohead.</div><br/><br/>Eh?!??! So, if the bands they champion are so flippin' popular, how come they're selling so little?!?!??!?! Could it possibly be that the mag's not very good?!?!?!?! And all this guffola to the effect that Select "helped create the mid-90s Britpop boom"!!!!!!! (Funny, I though the word in question was invented by Melody Maker!!!) This is supposedly due to the 1993 front cover with Suede on the front cover (Again, I seem to remember Melody Maker beat them on that score as well!!!!) and the laughable headline <i>"Yanks go home!"</i>!!!!!! Yes, well, look how well Suede did on that front!!!!!!!! They were upstaged on their US tour by their own flipping support band!!!!!!!! That would be bad enough, but their support band was <b>The Cranberries</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (!!!!!!!!!!) <br/><br/>Mind you, there's an interesting mention of the fact that the indie weeklies have been declining while the likes of Kerrang! and Mixmag have been doing rather well!!!!! Which would no doubt explain why the formerly "indie anorack" <b>NME</b> is going all "<a href="http://www.nmepop.com">pop</a>", and why the once mighty <b>Melody Maker</b> has suddenly plummeted <a href="http://www.melodymaker.co.uk/darts/darts.html">downhill</a> in a desperate attempt become a tabloidy "Kerrang!" Jnr!!!!!!!!!!
