Just hours before hearing the news about MM, I read an interesting article on UK teletext (p453, CH4) about the declining circulation of music publications after the closure of Select... Including a spot-on prediction that Melody Maker in particular, with sales down to around 32,000, was being talked of in the industry as the next for the chop! Strangely enough, MM's bosses IPC would not comment for the article... <br/><br/>The piece (written by Iain Gittins, a former MM dude himself) tried to work out what has gone "wrong" with the music press... Well, perhaps the article itself went some way to illustrating how some journos in the titles most affected have lost the plot a little!!! Throughout the article, the assumption was made that the "Dadrock" contigent (ie Q, Mojo, Uncut) are the main beneficiaries of the circulation wars because they focus on past glories!!! "No new acts?!? Quick, grandpa, stick John Lennon on tha cover again!!!!" <br/><br/>But a look at the circulation figures (published at the end of the article) told a different story... Top seller is (appropriately enough) TOTP by a large margin, (300,000+ sales) followed by Smash Hits, (200,000+) and then a fair bit behind that is our first dadrock mag, Q!!!! (around 160,000) <br/><br/>Next it's a couple of the dance stalwarts Mixmag, (~98,000) closely followed by Ministry, (~96,000) with our next old folks mag Mojo again trailing by a significant margin.... And where's Uncut? Well, it's selling just above the fateful 50,000+ level that Select were hovering around when they were chopped, with the supposedly ailing NME beating them with weekly sales of around 75,000!!!! <br/><br/>The message I get from all this is that dadrock mags are routinely being spanked in the sales games by the pop glossies, and are struggling to keep up with the popularity of mainstream danceclub monthlies! <br/><br/>(Sorry, no link to the article- rather annoyingly, the <a href="http://www.teletext.co.uk/">Teletext UK</a> site appears to have dropped the Planet Sound section in their recent revamp!!!!!! Harmuph!!!!!!!!
