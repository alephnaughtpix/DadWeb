Hmmmm.... This seems a bit strange!!!!!!! Those cheeky chaps from Redmond (Microsoft!!!!!!!!) have put some online form that gauges how much your software is "risky"!!!!!! Apparently if you have loads of MS software with all the licenses, you're at a low risk!!!!!! But if you say on the questionnaire (which is IE compatible only, for some extraordinary reason!!!!!) that you download any software from tha NetWeb, suddenly you're in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/15101.html">a "high risk" situation</a>!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Hmmm.... I wonder if this has anything to do with the appearance of a new Outlook Express email worm, which slags off users for using Windows, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,40457,00.html">suggests they use Linux instead</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!
