Blimey!!!!!!! SC has got a mention on a popular music gramophone!!!!!! Well, actually, it's a "remake" of <b>Billy Joel</b>'s "We Didn't Start the Fire", which of course was a remake of REM's "The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)", which of course was a rremake of Bob Dylan's "Subterranian Homesick Blues", which of course was a remake of Tommy Steele's "Half a Sixpence"!!!!!!! Actually, I just made that last bit up, believe it or not!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Er, where was I!?!??!?! Anyway!!! Some enterprising peeps have remade the Billy Joel song calling it "<a href="http://www.fairvue.com/start/">We Didn't Start the Weblog</a>"!!!!!! And guess wot!!!! It's all about weblogs!!!! And it gives us a mention!!!!! Which is nice!!!!!<br/><br/>You can even get an mp3 of the "platter" in question <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/start/WeDidntStartTheWeblogs.mp3">here</a>!!!!! Tho I have to say I feel sorry for the poor guy who had to sing it all!!!!! He sounds like he's got the same cold as I had this week!!!!!
