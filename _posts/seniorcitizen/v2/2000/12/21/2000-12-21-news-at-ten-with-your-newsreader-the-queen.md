Welll, I never!!!!! Some Aussie boffins have analysed the Queen's voice from her annual Chrimbo Speech-os, and found that her voice has evolved over time to sound like that of a <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/21-12-19100-0-39-34.html">newsreader</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I can't wait for her next speech!!!!!! What's the bets she'll start the summing up by saying: <i>"And finally...."</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!! And then talking about some elephant on a skateboard or something!!!!!!!!! Actually, maybe that last bit is a little unlikely, to be honest!!!!!!!!
