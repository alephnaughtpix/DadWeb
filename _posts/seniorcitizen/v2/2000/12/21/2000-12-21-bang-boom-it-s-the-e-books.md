According to this story, E-books are "<a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/printer/6215">Set to Explode</a>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which sounds jolly dangerous if you ask me!!!!!! I mean, the advantages of the electronic book medium don't exactly in my mind outweigh the obvious disadvantages of a highly combustible piece of experimental technology!!!!!! And even if it were used for practical uses, such as propellant fuel, then it negates the need for writers!!!!!!!! I mean, if it's going to blow up anyway, one could write any old crap!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Mind you, having read some recent best-sellers, such a situation might not be too far from present day reality!!!!!!!!!!!!!
