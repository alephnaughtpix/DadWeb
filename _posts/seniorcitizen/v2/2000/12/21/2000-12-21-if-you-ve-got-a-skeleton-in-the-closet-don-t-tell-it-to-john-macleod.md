U-no, that funny little man from the Isles wot writes for the <b>Glasgow Herald</b>, John MacLeod, used to be really controversial!!!!! Used to write multiple firebrand fulminations regarding how homosexuals deserved to burned at the stake, quickly followed by the Roman Catholics, etc., ... !!!!!! But then for strange some reason, he suddenly quietened down!!!!!!!! Now he's managed to excite some controversy again!!!! In his <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/macleod/archive/19-12-19100-21-48-18.html">latest column</a> (ooh-err!!!!), he writes screeds about how society is supposed to be failing children or suchlike!!!!! So wot, you may think, but then he gives a couple of examples from his homeplace, the Isle of Harris!!!! Incuding this one:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">There's a little boy I call Twenty Questions, for whenever I meet him - he's allowed to wander the village at all hours, while mum props up a bar - he asks this and that and the next thing.</div> <br/> <br/>Unfortunately for him, the mother of said child was most annoyed and wrote a big letter into the Herald slagging him off!!!!! And they <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/letters/archive/21-12-19100-23-19-11.html#RTFToC9">published it</a>!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/><div class="quote">Does Mr Macleod realise just how damaging his malicious statements can be to a person? When I first moved to this island just over two years ago I had my first experience of how accusations fly round here. This culminated in the police and social work department arriving at my then place of work because of an anonymous phone call to the police accusing me of something very similar to what Mr MacLeod has.</div> <br/> <br/>Bet the islanders are really pleased with McLeod for helping to generate this really spiffy Xmas advert for the Isle of Harris, eh!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Mind you, you'd think that as a journalist ol' Johnny boy would be a bit more wary of the problems that can be caused by spreading around stories about people from behind their back... After all, there was this journalist- let's call him Funny Little Man From The Isles Wot Writes For The Glasgow Herald- who used to write multiple firebrand fulminations regarding how homosexuals deserved to burned at the stake, quickly followed by the Roman Catholics, etc., ... !!!!!! And then he had to stop when he realised that if he continued in such a vein, there would be a lot of people who be quite happy to point out that he had just been <a href="http://www.scottishmediamonitor.com/articles2.cfm?ID=55" title="'I will come out in my own time and in my own way and on my own terms'- er, woops!!!!">outed in a gay magazine</a>!!!!!!!
