This is a bizzare new hacking trick!!!! Apparently one can use a web server to time the speed that a browser requests stuff in order to <a href="ttp://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/00/q4/1205-browser.htm">test if something is in the cache</a>!!!!!!! This can be accessed by remote sites and can therefore be used as a kind of "unofficial" cookie!!!!!!!!!! Which can no doubt be used to steal your credit card details, etc., etc., .... <br/><br/>Pah!!!!! Grown up w3surfers shouldn't really be using their cache anyway!!!!!!!!! I certainly don't!!!!!! But then again, I've got no choice- my browser's really old!!!!!!!!!!!!!
