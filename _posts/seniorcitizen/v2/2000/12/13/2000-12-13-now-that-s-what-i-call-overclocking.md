Hmmmm... I think someone is taking overclocking their PC hardware to extremes when they start using water tubs, hoses and hydraulic pumps in order to <a href="http://www.agaweb.com/coolcpu/_disc1/00000a57.htm">cool their compute</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Mind you, it could be handy!!!!! His compute will already have an inbuilt fire extinguisher in case he really overclocks it, and as a result sets his house on fire!!!!!!!!
