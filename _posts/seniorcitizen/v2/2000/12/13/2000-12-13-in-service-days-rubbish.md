Apparently, according to <a href="http://www.linezine.com/2.1/features/bsbgsldg.htm">this article</a> a lot of training and on-line education is complete crap!!!!!!! This is because:<ul><br/><li>People do courses to avoid work!!!!!<br/><li>Companies just do it to look nice!!!!!<br/><li>Some training just tells you what to do, but doesn't do anything else, so when you come against something not in the textbook, you're up a well known creek minus rowing equipment!!!!!!<br/><li>People treat it like a re-enactment of Gladiator!!!!!!!!!<br/></li></li></li></li></ul>This article mentions something called "unlearning" as well, which would be jolly useful, because if applied correctly, it could enable me to forget that dreadful <b>S Club 7</b> gramphone I heard the other day on tha tellybox!!!!!!!!!!
