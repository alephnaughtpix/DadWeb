Hey!!!! I bet you never knew showings of <b>The Simpsons</b> are cut to ribbons in the UK!!!!!!!! Well, the bloke wot runs this next spiffy w3site does!!!!!!!!! Yes, apparently the TV "high heid yins" in the UK have, as usual, decided that cartoons, like Sci-Fi, is a load of kids stuff, and so are more than a little put out to discover that shows like The Simpsons are regarded as adult shows in the US!!!!! And as a result the Beeb and Blob (!!!!) tend to get their editing scissors out on occasion!!!!!! Which is a jolly big shame, as it means UK audiences have yet to experience the pleasure of Bart calling someone a "bastard"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Until they get the official (and uncut) Simpsons videos for their kids that is!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Why is there a national outcry about this counterproductive censorious outrage?!?!??!?!?! Well, you can make a start by going to the very wonderful "<b><a href="http://www.depro.co.uk/page11.html">Snipsons</a></b>" webby sitey!!!!!!!!!!!
