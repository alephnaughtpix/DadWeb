Cripes!!!!! Even the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/28/technology/28BLOG.html?printpage=yes">New York Times</a> is plugging this webby loggy business!!!!!!! Wot with all this hype starting to do a "bubble" and stuff, it looks like it won't be too long before there's a "dotcom" style weblog crash!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So it's survival of the fittest in Blogland!!!!!!! And to test the fitness of your weblog, why not try the <b><a href="http://grudnuk.com/killyrblog/">"Kill Your Weblog" Test</a></b>, which rates your weblogs chances of survival in the event of major 'log burn!!!!! (Doh!!!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>According to the test, which I answered completely at random and blindfolded, (Which of course perfectly mirrors the wild and wacky off-tha-wall style of our, erm, wild and wacky off-tha-wall w3zine!!!!!!) and got the following results!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">Your weblog rating is 61%<br/>What a nice weblog you have! I imagine if you hang around the scene long enough someone might actually notice.<br/><br/>PS Please do not take screenshots of this dialog box.</div><br/><br/>Well, as you can see, I'm a man of my word!!!!!!!!
