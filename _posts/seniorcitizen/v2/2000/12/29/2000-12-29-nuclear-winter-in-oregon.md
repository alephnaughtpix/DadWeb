Looks like much predicted <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1721325">floods</a> didn't happen to Glasgow!!!!!!! But something else did!!!!!!!!! And the previous predictions weren't too good in that area either!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Yes, that right!!!!!!! <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=35665">Bazillions of inches of snow</a> have blanketed us over the past couple of days!!!!!!!!!!!!! As a result, I have been partaking of a significant number of hot toddies in the interim period, I can tell you!!!!!!! <br/><br/>But even our inclement weather pales into insignifcance compared to a nuclear winter!!!!!!!!!! But apparently that's what has happened to <a href="http://dailynews.netscape.com/mynsnews/story.tmpl?table=n&amp;cat=50100&amp;id=200012272344000220759">some place in the US called Oregon</a>!!!!!!!! And they didn't even "nuke" it either!!!!!!!!!!! Tho I have heard from certain US correspondants that it needn't neccessarily be a bad thing.
