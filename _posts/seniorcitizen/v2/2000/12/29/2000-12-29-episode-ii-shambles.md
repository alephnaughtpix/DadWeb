Well, here's a w3site we haven't linked to for a long time- <b><a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/">Ain't It Cool News</a></b>!!!!!!!!! Apparently, there's a bit of "discussion" about whether the much vaunted Star Wars Episode II is <a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=7783">getting rewritten or not</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Mind you, as usual with AICN, we always have to say... <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/1.html#20">Remember the "ZX Shrink Chamber" story</a>....!!!!!!!!
