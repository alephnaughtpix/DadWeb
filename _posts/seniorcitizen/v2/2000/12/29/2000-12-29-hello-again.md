Yes!!!!! I've managed to sober up from my drunken festive haze long enough to say hello to all you nice people again for wot looks like the final <b>Senior Citizen</b> missive of 2000!!!!! And I'll be glad to see the back of it!!!!!!! (The year 2000 of course, not SC!!!!! Not that SC's actually going of course!!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!?!) <br/><br/>Anyway, good riddance to Y2K!!!!!! Not least because it finally means we'll get a rest from all the usual bores who go <i>"Oh, the millenium <b>really</b> starts in 2001!!!!!!!!! It didn't really start in 2000!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!! Look, you twerps!!!!!!! It probably isn't starting in 2001 either, because we don't know for sure exactly when "Year 1" actually began!!!!!!! In fact, the best guesses are that the new millenium actually started in the mid-90s!!!!!!! So marking the millenium is just a matter of marking an important date and having a jolly big party to celebrate!!!!!!!! So I picked 2000!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Mind you, I'm having second thoughts now!!!!!!!! Maybe 2001 was a better date after all!!!!!! Tell you wot, I think I'll have a jolly big party to celebrate the new millenium now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
