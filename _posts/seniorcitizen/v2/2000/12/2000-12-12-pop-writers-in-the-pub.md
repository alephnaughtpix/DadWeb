Well, you might have wondered what pop writers do when they're not writing about pop music!!!!! Well, the universal answer appears to be... Down tha Pub!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Well, OK, this is in the UK, obviously!!!!!!!! In Europe they sit around cafes in the open air and talk about Neiztche or something!!!!!!! In the US, they hang out with some band backstage and snaffle all their drugs and groupies!!!!!!! But in the UK, it's tha pub!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Great huh?!??! Bet you wonder why they hardly ever write about such an exciting life instead of boring old tepid indie bollox!!!!!!!! However this lot do!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yes, the team behind <b><a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~tewing/singlesb.html">New York London Paris Munich</a></b> (As recommended by that young chap <a href="http://members.aol.com/blissout/front.htm"><b>Simon Reynolds</b></a>, who reads a lot of books and stuff, which is no doubt why he keeps quiet about his sisters <b>The Reynolds Girls</b>, of "I'd rather Jack!!!!!! (Than Fleetwood Mac!!!!)" fame!!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!??!) Oh yes, the NYLPM bunch also do a rolling weblog about pubs in London!!!!! It's called "<b><a href="http://pumpkinpublog.blogspot.com/">Pumpkin Publog</a></b>", and check the size of the flipping archive!!!!!!
