Crikey O'Reilly!!!!!! I guess the Republic of Ireland has changed a little recently regarding the power of the Catholic Church in it's internal affairs!!!!!!!!! Check out this quote regarding <b>Bill Clinton</b>'s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Leading_articles/2000-12/leaderb121200.shtml">current visit to the country</a>:<br/><br/><div class="quote">As one resident of Dundalk noted yesterday: "He is bigger than the Pope." </div><br/><br/>!!!!!!!! Well, if you ask me, The Beatles were a bunch of idiots for making their "bigger than Jesus" type comments in the US in 1965!!!!!! They should have jumped into a TARDIS, went to Dublin in 2000, and said it there instead!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So much for being the best band in the world!!!!!!!!!!
