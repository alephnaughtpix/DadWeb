Lord of bestselling books (Well, OK then- he writes books, and he just happens to be an enobled gentleman then!!!!!) <b>Jeffrey Archer</b> as we <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1639369">mentioned earlier</a> is still fighting a court case.... But what you might not know is that he's been thrown out of court!!!!!! And it's all his fault!!!!!!!!! But in this case, it's all right, he's not going to jail- because it's all an act!!!!!!!!! Yes, Archer's self-penned play <b>The Accused</b>, in which he plays the titular role (Oooh-err, misuss!!!) in a courtroom drama, (Which is presumably in no way like the courtroom drama he's about to take part in for real!!!!!!!! Or he would get "done" by the "Rozzers"!!!!!!!!!) is shutting down because of <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=33758&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Fuk%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=id%3D33758&amp;navlevel2=">poor audience numbers</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Presumably, Archer went to "appeal" the "verdict", but his "objection" was "overruled"!!!!!!!!!!!
