Well, the chance of us folks in Glasgow, Scotland getting a White Christmas are about one in thirty squillion!!!!!!!!! (!!!!!) But we might be getting a slightly late Brown Christmas- Clyde Brown, that is!!!!!!!!!! No, we're not talking about the latest "trendy" Radio Scotland presenter!!!!!!! We're in fact talking about about a large body of water which runs through a city!!!!!!!!!! It turns out that the River Clyde, which runs through the centre of Glasgow (And is a little mucky- in much the same way as the continent of Antartica is a little "brisk"!!!!!!) is in danger of bursting it's banks next Thursday, and causing <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/20-12-19100-0-13-54.html">city centre flooding</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Better get my Christmas shopping done quickly, then!!!!!!!!!
