Honestly!!!!!!!! Wot a bunch of wimps we are over here!!!!!!!!! A little bit of freak snow on tha roads and everyone goes crazy!!!!!! Now someone's calling for the appointment of yet another flipping <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_03_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1554937">czar/csar/tsar/tzar/xsar/xzar/zzar/zsar/szar/etc</a>!!!!!!!! This time, it's to be a "<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/29-12-19100-23-39-22.html">roads czar</a>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently, someone needs to tell everyone that they should be vigilant towards the possiblility of snow and icy roads during winter!!!!!!!!! Funny how such situations seem to handled each year by folks in the Nordic regions!!!!!! Where winter temperatures regularly reach what the <b>Glasgow Herald</b> describes as: <br/><br/><div class="quote">between -10[[ordmasculine]]C and -14[[ordmasculine]]C</div><br/><br/>Anyway, how many "czars" would that be that we've got now!??!?!??! And what do they all do?!?!?! Why are they called "czars" anyway?!?!??! Is because they get a lot of money and nobody really knows what they actually do to merit their position?!?!??!?!?!?
