Well, there's a bit of legal business going on at the mo regarding whether book-writing bod <b>Jeffrey Archer</b> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/This_Britain/2000-12/archer121200.shtml">told a few fibs or not</a>!!!!!!!!!!!! But if he were ever to be found guilty and sent away, don't worry!!!!!!!!! One of the characters in his books can step forward and carry on writing!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Yes, <b>Saddam Hussein</b>, who was featured in one of Archers fictional novels recently in a somewhat fictional capacity, and whom <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/20.html">we haven't mentioned for a bit</a>, is rumoured to be behind an <a href="http://www.arabia.com/article/print/0,4973,34328,00.html">anonymously written fictional story</a>, which is selling rather well in his native Iraq!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Wot next?!??!?! "General Pinochet's 101 Favourite Limericks"?!?!??!?!?!
