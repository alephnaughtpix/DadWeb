Makes you wonder if peeps are taking a huge risk in sending in stuffs to the <b>Glasgow Herald</b> Letters page, when the folks at the ancient paper print the letterrs under such bizzare headlines as "<b><a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/letters/archive/12-12-19100-22-38-56.html">Glasgow is not like San Diego</a></b>"!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Next they'll be telling us that <b>Kirkintilloch</b> bears little resemblence to the Rock of Gilbratar!!!!!!!!!!!
