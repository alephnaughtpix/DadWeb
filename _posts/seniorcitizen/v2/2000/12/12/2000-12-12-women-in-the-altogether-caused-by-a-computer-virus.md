Well, I guess you're probably getting over the shock of that pasty young woman showing off her spare tire in that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1077000/1077165.stm">"Opium" poster advert</a>!!!!! But if that image appeared in a Japanese website, the authorities might have had a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/Digital/Update/2000-12/APnude121200.shtml">slightly different reaction to it</a>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">Police are investigating how an image of a nude woman made its way on to the website of Japan's top security organization. <br/><br/>"At this point, nothing has been concluded, only that it was not caused by a virus," said a spokesman at the National Police Agency. </div><br/><br/>Wot!??!?! You had to "conclude" that it wasn't a virus?!?!?!?! Under exactly circumstances could a computer virus cause a website to suddenly display a member of fairer gender sans apparel!?!??!?!??! <br/><br/>One would have thought that if such a virus existed, those "adult" w3sites would be using them- for "stealth" advertising purposes!!!!!!!!!!!!
