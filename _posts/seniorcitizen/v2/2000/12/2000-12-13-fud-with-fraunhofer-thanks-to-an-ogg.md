First the music industry got afraid of something called MP3, then the MP3 folks got afraid of something called... <b><a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html">Ogg Vorbis</a></b>!!!!!!!! This is new open source sound format which hopes to have similar compression and sound quality to MP3!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>But, hold your seats!!!!!! According to this story, the folks who own a lot of patents on the MP3 format are a bit miffed about it, and threaten to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-4101023.html">sue the rear entrances off the Vorbis crowd</a>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">"We doubt very much that they are not using Fraunhofer and Thomson intellectual property," Linde said. "We think it is likely they are infringing."</div><br/><br/>The funny thing is that as Ogg Vorbis was designed precisley to avoid this prob!!!! And since it's open source, they could just check the source code to find out if they're infringing any patents!!!!!!!!!!! No wonder one of the team behind Ogg is <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=00/12/11/2347252&amp;cid=104">pretty calm about the whole thing</a>!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">Between the lines, it says, "we're worried/scared, they're on our radar, and we need to make some noise. Words are cheaper than lawyers."</div><br/><br/>I wonder if the Thompson/Fraunhofer peeps are a bit more "man" enough to try throwing their patents around against a rather bigger grouping of people!!!!!! Phillips, Cisco, Sun, Apple and Cisco have been in talks about agreeing a <a href="http://www.ism-alliance.org/">common streaming format</a> <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,20770,00.html?nl=dnh">early next year</a>, with AOL (the parent company of Winamp's HQ!!!!) interested!!!!!!!! And it's not MP3-based either!!!!!!!! It's <a href="http://www.cselt.it/leonardo/icjfiles/mpeg-4_si/"><b>MPEG-4</b></a>, which is an open standard!!!!!!!! And we mentioned it in <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/7.html#200">one of our more ancient issues</a> as well!!!!!!!!
