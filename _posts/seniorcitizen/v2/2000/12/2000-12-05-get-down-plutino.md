Well, after all that debate about whether or not <b>Pluto</b> <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/22.html#655">is really a planet or not</a>, (Much to Mickey Mouse's annoyance, no doubt!!!!!!) astronomers have now found a "plutino" <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/science/planet102400.htm">inbetween Neptune and Pluto</a>!!!! <br/><br/>This story helpfully tells us that the minor planetoid, snappily titled "2000 EB173" is <i>"about one-fourth the size of Pluto (or about the distance from Boston to Buffalo)"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Erm... OK then!!!!! Thanks very much for that useful piece of info!!!!! Next time I travel from Buffalo to Boston, I'll be able to say <i>"Aha!!!! This is roughly equal to the diameter of a planetoid between Neptune and Pluto!!!!!!!!!!"</i> And I expect the Buffalo would have some pretty choice words on the matter as well!!!!!!!!
