U-no, sometimes there's nothing better than having a "wee dram"!!!!!!! By which I of course mean a small glass of whisky- not a close encounter with a certain farmyard animal, as you may think!!!!!!!!! But what I didn't know is that I might end up on Mastermind as a result of it!!!!!!!! (The drink, not the farmyard animal!!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>That's because some boffins have found out that occasional drinkers have <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/7-12-19100-0-13-34.html">higher IQs than teetotallers</a>!!!!!!!!! Tho mind you, it might also have to do with the ridiculous names they give alcohol!!!!!!! I mean, if you know how to spell "<a href="http://www.scotchwhisky.com/english/about/malts/regislay.htm"><b>Bunnahabhain</b></a>", then you've got to have some braincells!!!!!!!
