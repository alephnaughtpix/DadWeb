Looks like the plan to put Bill Clinton in as <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_03_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1565272">Chancellor of Oxford Uni</a> is stepping up a gear!!!!! He's obviously being nice to the Oxford folks he shared his non-inhalation experimentation episode with, by saying in an interview with dull-but-worthy rock tome <b>Rolling Stone</b> (Again, classic Oxford Uni demographics!!!!) that he does think people who smoke "special" cigarettes <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001206/ts/clinton_pot_dc_2.html"> shouldn't be slammed into the clinker</a>!!!!!! (By which we mean jail, not Bill's... Er hang on, cancel that thought!!!!!!! Bleeeuuurrrrghhh!!!!!!! Groooo!!!!! Etc. )
