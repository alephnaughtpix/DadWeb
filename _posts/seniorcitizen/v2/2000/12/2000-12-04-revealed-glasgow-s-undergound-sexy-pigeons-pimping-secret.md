Now here's a vaguely interesting story for all you pigeon racers!!!!!!! Apparently some male pigeons are real "Ladies Men"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And apparently some pigeon racing folk in my local area of Glasgow are using these avian "Peter Stringfellows" to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_medical/story.jsp?story=11506">"nab" lady pidgeons</a> from their rivals!!!!!!!!!! And it's often ending in kneecappings!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Even more bizarrely, these "pigeon pimps" are known as "horsemen"!!!!!!!!! Just as well they don't breed poultry!!!!!! Who knows, maybe they would have been called "donkey bangers" or something!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
