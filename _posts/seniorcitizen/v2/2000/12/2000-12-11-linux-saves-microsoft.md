Don't you just love business heads getting the wrong end of the stick when it comes to non-Business issues?!?!??!?! The amusingly named <b>Hal Plotkin</b> comes to the surprising conclusion that if Linux starts seriously eating into the Windows market, then Microsft may turn around and do it's <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/news/001208plotkin.html">own version of Linux in direct competition</a>!!!!!!<br/><br/>As, usual, there's loads of "Woe!!! The End is Nigh!!!!" and "mikkkro$oft suxxx!!!" type nonsense from <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=00%2F12%2F09%2F1840253&amp;cid=&amp;pid=0&amp;startat=&amp;threshold=1&amp;mode=flat&amp;commentsort=0&amp;op=Change">Slashdot posters</a>, most of whom seem to miss the very obvious question marks surrounding such a concept!!!!!<br/><br/>How exactly would Microsoft do their own versh of Linux??!?!?! Given that a lot of the code is GPLed or under some other sort of licence, they can't exactly make all of thier Linux distro proprietary, and if they can't do that, then there's nothing stopping people getting their software from places other than MS!!!! <br/><br/>If on the other hand, they used GPL'ed code for a micro-kernel, and then program their own proprietary Windows-compatible user interface around it, then all you've got left is another version of Windows with slightly different workings under the hood!!!!!!! Effectively it wouldn't be Linux any more- and why would people who were interested in Linux be necessarily interested in a new versh of Windows just because it's got a revamped Linux style microkernel?!?!?!? Microsoft might as well use Linux code in Windows rather than the other way round, and sell it to existing Windows users!!!!!!! <br/><br/>And according to rumours, this is <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-11/lw-11-penguin_4.html">exactly what's happening</a>... And as the writer notes, the main problem with getting someone else's company to do your "R&amp;D" work for you is that you're always behind them by at least one step!!!!!
