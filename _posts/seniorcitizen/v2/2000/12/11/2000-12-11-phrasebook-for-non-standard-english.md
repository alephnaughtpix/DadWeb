Well, if you want to learn English, don't whatever you do, check this site out!!!!!! That's because it's a webby version of an old phrase-book called "<a href="http://www.fragment.com/~ganz/spoke.html"><b>English as She is Spoke</b></a>"!!!!!!!! Mind you, if need to learn English, you probably won't understand wot I just said!!!!!!<br/><br/>Anyway, for the rest of you folks- you might want to check this out!!!!! Within hours you'll be using such helpful phrases as <i>"Cat scalded fear the cold water"</i> and <i>"Of the hand to mouth, one lose often the soup"</i>!!!!!!! Tho, to find any reference to mobile phones in this tome is <i>"To look for a needle in a hay bundle"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!
