Wow!!!!! That was flippin' quick!!!!!!!! Merely hours after I <a href="http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=004Ez6">pointed out on a message board</a> the appearance of a story hinting that the days of ancient music weekly <b>Melody Maker</b> might be numbered, along comes a news item on NME's site saying MM is <a href="http://www.nme.com/NME/External/News/News_Story/0,1004,11245,00.html">getting "merged" with the NME</a>!!!!! The next issue is the final one!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Of course, it's brought out all the usual "end of an era" type stories from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1070000/1070699.stm">usual suspects</a>, most of whom basically rewrite the flippin NME story!!!! (And some even rip off the Billy Corgan cover piccy used on the NME site!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>Well, coming from someone who's read it since 1992 (When they had Suede on the front cover and still subtitled themselves "Tomorrow's Music Today"!!!!!) I have to say: I'm not at all surprised that MM's been "merged" to death!!!!!! The bloody things being going downhill for the past couple of years, and really started to nosedive toward Destination Gutterland this year, culminating in the laughable "Up Your Delors!!!" style "campaign" against UK Garage and for "our" type of music to be heard in the charts!!!!!! Tho they were a little quiet on what exactly "our" type of music was, and why it had any more right to be in the charts than S Club 7, especially considering how much of it was boring twaddle like <b>Coldplay</b>!!!!!!!!!!!! I must admit when I saw their cover "UK Garage My Arse", and then listened to the enclosed free CD, that I had to agree with the headline- compared to the average UK Garage track, MM's compil definately did sound like a lot of arse!!!!!!!!!! But apparently, it was still alright to like pop in an "ironic" way!!!!!! So exactly why did they pick on UK Garage and Craig David in particular?!?!?!? I mean, surely there are more deserving targets like certain boy-bands (eg Westlife), but no, MM seemed to randomly pick on the black dude!!!!!! No wonder the sales had plummeted by around 21% in the past couple of months!!!!!!!
