Yay!!!!!! We're back online after that problem Blogspot had with their backbone!!!!!!!!!!!! And just in time for Chhristmas!!!! I've stilll been posting the odd story tho- not as much as I expected, because I was rather busy!!!!!!!! Especially with the run up to the festive season!!!!!!! (Mind you, the fact that I can run up to the festive season at all is a testiment to my strength of fitness at this late stage in life!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>Not that everyone sees this!!!!!! When I was going homewards on the vehicular omnibus, laden with Xmas fayre, what should assault my eyeballs but a disgraceful piece of graffitied slander against the older generation!!!!!! Yes!!!!! Someone had scrawled on the bus wall: <br/><br/><div class="quote">All pensioners should stay at home and leave the normal people in peace</div><br/><br/>Well, naturally, I wasn't going to take this insult lying down!!!!!! Not that I was lying down of course!!!!!! I was in fact sitting on a seat!!!!! Well, anyway, I wasn't going to take it sitting down either!!!!!! It was time to send a message to the young ruffians (or "neds" as they call them up my end!!!!) who were responsible for this outrage!!!!!!!! So, I quickly scuttled up to the offending scribe with my trusty bingo marker in hand, crossed out the first six letters of "pensioners", and changed the final "r" of that word to "d"!!!!! At which point, I got a standing ovation from the rest of the bus!!!!!! Then the bus driver noticed me taking a bow to the grateful masses, stopped the bus, and took a look at my handiwork!!!!! Then he shaked my hand, got back in the cab, and continued driving!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So take that, you young whippersnappers!!!!!!
