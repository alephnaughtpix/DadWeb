Let me warn you, dear readers, that age does not necessarily lead to wisdom!!!!! In fact, it's often quite the opposite!!!! It takes a lot of hard work to maintain one's level of intelligence at a later stage in life, and you'll no doubt be glad to learn that I am up to handling the responsibilities of being an elder spokesperson of my generation!!!!! (Which is not "Generation X" as you may think!!!!!!!!!!!! In fact, it's probably more like "Generation F"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>So, if I were to, say, become an international world leader, then I think I could cope with this wizard wheeze!!!! A neuroscientest (Which means he's a brain surgeon, not a technition for "The Matrix" as you may think!!!!!!!!!!!) with the wonderful name of <b>Dr James Toole</b> is suggesting that world leaders get a regular check in case <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/news/2001/06/21/story/0000090893">they go do-lally</a>, and stick pencils up their nose, and a pair of underpants on their head!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>It'll be interesting to see the Whitehouse's reaction to this proposal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
