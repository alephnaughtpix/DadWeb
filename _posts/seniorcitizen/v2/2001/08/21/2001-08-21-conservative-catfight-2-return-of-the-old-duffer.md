Mind you, Toole might have a point!!!!!!!!!!! Never mind what she's like now, just take a look at flipping <i>archive</i> footage of Margaret Thatcher when she was PM!!!!! It was like the voters had entrusted the running of the UK to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/dot_c_biog.shtml">Dot Cotton</a> from Eastenders!!!!!!!!! Luckily, at some point near the end of the 80s, the general public came to their senses, and her popularity plummeted!!!! At which point, the Tories quickly replaced her as leader before the lost the election (Or, at least, they put off massive election defeat for another 5 years!!!!!!!!!) Now she occupies the strange position of being God to Conservative activists whilst being an laughable lumbering old dinosaur and election liability to everyone else!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So you would have thought that any Tory "high heid yin" looking for electoral recovery after a second massive election defeat would try and keep her out of the way!!!!! But you'd be wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!! In fact, she's just sunk their chances of recovering at the next election by writing a <a href="http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/08/21/ntory321.xml">letter to the Daily Telegraph</a> supporting the front-runner candidate Iain Duncan-Smith!!!!!!!! Hey Presto- <a href="http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/08/21/ntory21.xml">tonz</a> of <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=89852">news coverage</a>, Tory activists jump over themselves to vote for The Anointed One, and the general public piss themselves laughing for the next 4 years!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the march of <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_08_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5194510">campaigning newspaper columnists</a> continues!!!!!!!! The Scotsman's <b>Bill Jamieson</b> takes a rare break from his weekly paranoid <i>"Europe=Satan!!!!!!"</i> type columns to er, do a paranoid semi-<i>"Europe=Satan!!!!!!"</i> type column <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/text_only.cfm?id=100723">trashing Ken Clarke</a> becuase he doesn't think <i>"Europe=Satan!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!! (NB It even includes a contact address for a paranoid <i>"Europe=Satan!!!!!!"</i>-type pamphlet!!!!!)
