Well, you might have thought they were completely dead!!!! Deader than a dead mans dead bits, including his dead mans handle!!!!!!!!!! In fact, you might have thought they were deader than me!!!!!!!! Only of course, I'm not dead, and neither is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>!!!!! In fact, there's some interesting new stuffs from Blogger which might be the next "paradigm shift" for the superinphopipeway netwebby!!!!! Which either means it's the next "Netscape" type thing, or the next "Pointcast"!!!!!!!!!! And it's all to do with the fact that I'm not actually posting this to Blogger!!!!!!!!!! Confused?!?!??! I certainly was!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But this page marginally helps!!!!!!!!!! There's some spiffy XML "protocol" thingy called <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> that allows one to run a proggy on a NetWeb superserver by sending a little text file containg an XML command-line thingy!!!!!! If everything's fine in the XML command, it'll run the command, and give you back an XML message saying hello!!!!!!!! If it's not OK tho, it'll still send you an XML message back- telling you to go forth and multiply!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So bloody wot, I hear you roar!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, Blogger, the previously-really-"happening"-but-now-a-one-man-operation-automatic-netweb-online-webpub-website has made some of their website work on this new-fangled XML-RPC wheeze, and <a href="http://plant.blogger.com/api/">released the spec</a> to all peeps!!!!!!!! Already there's tonz of little progs which can post to Blogland without going through tha w3sitey!!!!!!!!!!! And here's <a href="http://www.hi.is/~sigfuso/blogbuddy/">one</a>, wot I used to post, like, this story!!!! <br/> <br/>Amazing, huh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And it's also getting a <i>"this is a new paradigm shift!!!" </i>type histrionics from <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/13/connectingWithBlogger">Dave Winer</a>, who, by a spectacular coincidence, is pretty big on XML-RPC!!!!!!!!!!! According to him, it's right up there with "Quark XPress, FileMaker, PageMaker, Eudora, Netscape, MSIE, StuffIt, and all kinds of other scriptable apps."
