Well, we've now had the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/newsnight/newsid_1506000/1506507.stm">debate on tha tellybox</a> between the two Tory leadership candidates- and wasn't it a load of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4244038,00.html">boring old shit</a>?!??!?!? About the only notable thing about was Kenneth Clarke finally getting Iain-Duncan Smith to admit he <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=90218&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">wasn't too hot</a> on joining the Euro!!!!!!!!! (Cue lots of bad "<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=90217&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">Clarke 'smokes' out IDS</a>" type puns!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Much more interesting is the increasingly bolshy ex-PM <b>John Major</b>, who decided to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=90158&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">trash Thatcher yet again</a>!!!!!!!!!! <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=90161&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">This time</a>, apparently she's responsible for the early 90s recession, the 1997 defeat, and all those sleaze allegations which dogged Major!!!!! In fact, it's becoming a bit of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,3605,540557,00.html">feeding frenzy</a> in the Conservative party at the mo!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And as if things couldn't get any stranger, one of IDS' campaign has just been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1507000/1507390.stm">expelled from the Tories</a> for being a bit too close to the British Nazi Party (BNP)!!!!! The old codger (Tho that'll earn no automatic sympathy vote from me!!!!) is one <b>Martin Griffin</b>, who is, erm, the dad of the current BNP leader, Nick Griffin!!!! <br/> <br/>Of course, he's currently huffing and puffing about being hard done by, but I think if I were a member of the Tories since 1948, (This is just being hypothetical- please don't faint on me!!!!!!!!!!) I would tend <i>not</i> to do things like introducing my son to the pre-BNP "<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,9061,541823,00.html">National Front</a>" party!!!!! I would also think twice before manning the phones for my wife, who just happened to be standing for the BNP!!!!!!!! Indeed, the idea of installing a special BNP membership phone line in my house might suggest itself to be a little contrary to the idea of me being chairman of the local Tory association!!!!!!! And if I was found out, I certainly wouldn't go around <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=90385">saying things like</a>:<br/> <br/><div class="quote">The two parties are almost the same in terms of long-term plans. In terms of manifestos of the Tories and the BNP, you can hardly tell the difference.</div> <br/> <br/>... And then claim that I haven't damaged the party in any way!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Of course, IDS is ultra quick to distance himself from such stuffs- which is rather odd, as he used to have rather <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,9061,541826,00.html">similar views</a> himself!!!!!!!!!!
