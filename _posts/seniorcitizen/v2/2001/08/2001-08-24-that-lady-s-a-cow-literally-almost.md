Have you ever had a walk in the country, looked across a field full of cows, and thought: <i>"Hmmmm!!!!!!!! I wonder what would be the result if I were to given one of those bovine quadrupeds a good hard rogering?!?!?!??!"</i> <br/> <br/>Well, to be honest, I haven't!!!!! But if you have, the result, in addition to the myriad colonies of insectoid beasties on your "goolies" and the RSPCA price on your head, might be this thingie wot US boffins have acheived: a fertisilied cow egg <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/search/story.html?f=/stories/20010822/659629.html&amp;qs=Scott%20Foster">with human DNA in it</a>!!!!!! And they didn't even need to "get jiggy" with the cow to do it!!!!!!!! <i>"Melding man and beast may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but it's not."</i> said some bloke.
