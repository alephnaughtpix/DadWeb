Bet Oasis are fuming now!!!!!!!!!!! All this received wisdom about having to make "classic" "traditional" "pop" songs, inspired by other "classic" "traditional" "pop" songs, that the average milk delivery sales assistant can whistle, in order to secure maximum Beatles Emulation Potential, Oasis do it to the full, and it doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!! (The obvious answer: why are you doing songs that milkmen can whistle?!??!?! The Beatles didn't become the biggest band in the world by appealing to such a narrow category of potential consumer!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>And then along comes Radiohead, release their two most wonderfully obtuse long-playing gramophones to date, and they've apparently become the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4241732,00.html">biggest US concert draws since the Beatles</a> and hit the front cover of Rolling Stone!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Wot's no doubt really miffing off certain record company execs in this Post-Napster climate (Wot, with US record sales <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2001/07/19/industry_downturn/print.html">actually going <i>down</i></a> for the first time in yonks!!!!!!) is that <i>"Radiohead and Capitol encouraged fans to copy and circulate free bootlegs of Kid A in its entirety across their own sites three weeks in advance of the album's official release, upon which it went straight to number one with no radio airplay, no video and no hit single."</i>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>(Of course, old duffer like me remember tha olden days when Capitol was alone in allowing radio stations to play their gramophones, whilst other record labels complained that, yup, airplay cost them record sales because people could hear the tunes for nowt!!!!!!!!)
