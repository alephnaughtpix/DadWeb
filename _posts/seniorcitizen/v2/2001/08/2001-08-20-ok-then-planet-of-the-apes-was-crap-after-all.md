U-no, I used to think that the reason that all those crap "blockbuster" movies (The sort that makes one wish to "bust" the "blocks" of the cretins who "greenlighted" it!!!! Or, alternatively, tie the miscreants to a train line, and "greenlight" a twenty squillion pound project to build a really spangly choo-choo train to travel in their vague direction!!!!!!!!! Woops were was I?!?!?!?!?!) Anyway, I always thought the reason that these movies always had posters with newspaper review quotes like<br/> <br/><div class="usenet"><b>BRILLIANT!!! FAB!!! </b>-The Sun</div> <br/><div class="usenet"><b>THE BEST MOVIE OF THE TRILLENIUM!!! </b>-The Mirror</div> <br/><div class="usenet"><b>BETTER THAN 'DAD'S ARMY'</b>!!!!! -The Mail</div> <br/><div class="usenet"><b>IT WAS SO BRILLIANT, MY HEAD EXPLODED!!!!!!!</b> -The Star</div> <br/> <br/>was because the people in the aforementioned newspapers are complete and utter buffoons!!!! <br/> <br/>But I was wrong!!!!!!!!! It turns out that the real reason is that they didn't watch the movie well enough and wrote a review ultra-quicko!!!!!!!! At least, that's this guy's <a href="http://www.torontostar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_PrintFriendly&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=997999259569">excuse</a>!!!!!! He also claims to have been overawed by the special effects to the extent that he didn't notice how boring the story was!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I never!!!!!!!!! It seems even film critics are human!!!!!!!!!!! What exciting times we live in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>BTW If you want a whole range of movie reviews, from the twerps to the brainyboxes, go <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">here</a>!!!!!!!!
