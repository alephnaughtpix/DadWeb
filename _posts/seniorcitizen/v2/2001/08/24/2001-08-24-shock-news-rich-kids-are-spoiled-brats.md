Apparently this is a new thing to them!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But luckily for these poor (OK, not literally "poor" obviously!!!!!!!! That would be a bit pointless wouldn't it!!!!!!!!!!!) people, along comes Dr. Susan Bradley, senior psychiatrist at The Hospital for Sick Children, professor at the University of Toronto and academic co-chairman of The Parenting Alliance says: <br/> <br/><div class="quote">It doesn't matter how much you spend on your kids if you're teaching them to fend for themselves.</div> <br/> <br/>And luckily for parents worried about spending too much, they've finally found out about that <b>Aibo</b> robot doggy thingy we've known about for yonks!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Sony is planning a big splashy launch for a new high-end toy in Canada, a robotic pet that will "grow up," respond to its name, even learn words, all for the low, low price of $2,300.</div> <br/> <br/>Just the sort of hot info tip you might want if you still think it's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/watchdog/reports/misc/vfmrdogs.shtml">last year</a>!!!!!!!!!!
