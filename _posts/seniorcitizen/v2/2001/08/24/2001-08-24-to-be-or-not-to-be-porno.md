Hmmm...!!!!! Looks like some folks in the wonderful world of broadsheets have discovered a hot new "trend" in filmaking called... "<a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/theatre/story.jsp?dir=237&amp;story=89919&amp;host=5&amp;printable=1">Shakespeare Porno</a>"!!!!!!!!!! In other words, blue movies... done in the style of Shakespeare!!!!!! Titles include <i>"A Midsummer Night's Cream"</i>, and<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Tromeo and Juliet (1996)- in which Tromeo masturbates to an interactive porn CD-rom called "As You Lick It" and Juliet calls 1-900-FUL-STAF for phone sex</div> <br/> <br/>There's even a prof taking an interest in it- one <a href="http://www.naughtyprofessor.com ">Richard Burt</a>, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Quite how this is different to the long list of "adult" "dramas" based on <b>other</b> genres (eg <i>"Sex Trek"</i>, <i>"Saturday Night Beaver"</i>, etc., etc., !!!!!!) is one question which the article somehow fails to answer!!!!!!! Maybe they haven't noticed it, because they're a bunch of stuck-up knobs- which would be strangely appropriate when you think of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
