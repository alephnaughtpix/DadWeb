In any case!!!!!! Apparently, a little bit of randomness is not a bad thing!!!! In fact, according to one or two top boffins, a little bit of chaos in the brainbox department is <a href="http://unisci.com/stories/20013/0820011.htm">quite normal</a>!!!!!!!!!! <i>"Quantitatively, such behavior is associated with a positive Lyapunov exponent, a hallmark of chaos"</i> said some bloke. <br/> <br/>Mind you, if they really wish to see some serious Lyapunov exponent action, then maybe they should stick their electrodes into Margaret Thatchers bonce!!!! Perhaps she might finally become of some use to Humankind!!!!!!!!!!!!!
