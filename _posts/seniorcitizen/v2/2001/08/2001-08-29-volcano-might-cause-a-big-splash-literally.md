Well, it might destroy the Canary Islands, New York, Florida, a good part of Morocco and the Brazilian coast, but it'll cause a good "swell" in surfer regions in tha UK!!!!!<br/> <br/>It's all to do with the Cumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma in the Canary Isles, where you get pigeons from!!!!!! Apparently, the next time it erupts, "part of a mountain twice the size of the Isle of Man falls into the Atlantic" and causes a "mega tsunami" (which sounds like some 8 year old receiving a Britney Spears CD, then sneezing whilst asking for their mumy!!!!) which will splosh New York, Miami, and large parts of the Brazil coastline out of existance!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Mind you, by the time it reaches the UK, it'll only be 40ft high, so no doubt a lot of "surf" dudes will be out to "ride" the "surf", or whatever it is these young whippersnappers do!!!!! And just think- if you can ride the wave, you'll be able to surf straight into town!!!!! Mind you, there might not be any town to surf into afterwards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
