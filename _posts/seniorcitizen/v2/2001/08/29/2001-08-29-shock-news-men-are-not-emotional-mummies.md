Hello, dear readers!!!!!!!!! Are you a man?!?!?!?!? Well, OK, I don't mean: "is the entire collective readership of Senior Citizen composed of just myself!??!?!?"!!!!!!!!!! And I certainly don't mean to ask if all 23 readers of this venerable organ (By which I mean SC, not my other venerable organ, which few have seen, but those who have have been most impressed I can tell you!!!!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!??!) have been combined into a gestalt super-entity whose gender is of the male variety!!!!!! I was referring of course the the individual reader wot might be reading this doggerel, and not everyone!!!!!! Erm... Where was I again?!?!??!?!<br/> <br/>Anyway!!!!!! If you (the individual reader) are of the not-so-fairer gender of the opposite sex, wot you might not realise is that some might mistake you for the the other fair gender of the other opposite sex!!!!!! And what's more, they might think you're a crybaby, and that a baby has popped out of your bum!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>This is not because just such people are complete cretins!!!!!!! Apparently there's some widely-held belief that men are "emotional mummies"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I wasn't aware of this!!!!! But don't worry, apparently, it's a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/620211.asp?cp1=1">load of crap</a>!!!!!!!!!!! Men are supposed to have no problems with their emotions according to boffins, which is just as well, because until then I was walking around like a robot, and asking women What It's Like To Human!!!!!!!!  (Actually- I was joking there!!!!!!!!!!! Or am I?!??!?!?!)<br/> <br/>Mind you, given all the claptrap that appears to be talked about gender relations these days, I'm not too surprised!!!!!!! Take a look at this!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"People fervently believe that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, but the data consistently suggest that this is either inaccurate or grossly overstated"</div> <br/> <br/>Hmmm!!!!!! Innaccurate!??!?!? Overstated!??!?!?!? I'd say it's bloody impossible in fact!!!!!!!!!!! Neither Mars nor Venus can support human life, you idiots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
