Well, I never!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently, really hip-to-beat newsy service <b>Wired</b> has found out that "<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,46271,00.html">Jupiter's Moons Are Weird Places</a>"!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>And here's me thinking they were just boring balls of rock!!!!!!!!!! (Mind you, maybe Wired News was thinking of the incredibly boring 80s UK "soap opera" <b>Jupiter Moon</b>!!!!!!!!!)
