Well, it's a bit quiet after <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_08_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5275518">last weekend</a> when people were queuing up to give a <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=91137&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">good kicking</a> to anyone with British Nazi Party associations in the Conservative party!!!!! The BNP claimed themselves, with typical cognitive dissonance, to not really being in favour of infiltrating the Tories, having just boasted about having <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=90710">150-200 of their members in the party</a>!!!! Still, nice to see they're being about "welcoming" their members working for other parties and not being too honest about it, unlike nearly evry politcal party in the UK!!!!!!!!! Sounds like the sort of "democratic" party you could always trust, eh!!!!!!!! Perhaps they should just be honest, and rename themselves to "<b>Lying Fifth-Columnist Nazi Morons R Us!!!</b>"!??!?!?!??!<br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!!! Iain Duncan-Smith is a little upset after all this malarkey, and is making a jolly big effort to tell everyone he'll be <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4246342,00.html">nice to Johnny Foreigner</a>, (Unless they come Europe, presumably!!!) and even that he's a "One Nation" Tory!!!! Which has caused <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/text_only.cfm?id=103235">much hilarity</a> amongst certain columnists!!!! Mind you, some columnists are even more confusing in their reasoning!!!! One in particular, thinks that IDS might "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,543663,00.html">drawn the poison</a>" from the BNP if he becomes leader, as he will be an alternative to the current "consensus" on race relations, forgetting that: <br/><ol type="a"><li>The current consensus from Labour/Tory on race is: <i>"Racism is bad, but Asylum Seekers are worse!!!! So we'll just call them Asylum Seekers instead, because everyone (Or, at least, the Sun) knows they're a bunch of filthy lying scroungers anyway!!!!!!!!!!"</i> <br/><li>As the columns notes itself, having a mainstream politician (Assuming of course IDS were ever to do this...) talk a load of racist cobblers will just encourage the boneheads on the fringes!!!<br/><li>This assumes that the Tories will be the only opposition, and race is the only issue anyone's interested in!!!! But there's already serious talk of the Libdems, under "Cheeky Chappy" Charlie Kennedy, actually in danger of <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4245937,00.html">replacing the Tories as a serious oppostion party</a> on a wide range of issues, which people might actually give a Scooby Doo about, thus providing an actual proper alternative to the Labour/Tory "consensus"!!!!!!!!!!!<br/></li></li></li></ol> <br/> <br/>The other big story was a little opinion poll for IDS-supporting broadsheet <b>The Sunday Telegraph</b>, which put IDS' support amongst Conservative members at 76% compared to 24% for his rival Kenneth Clarke, who immediately attacked the poll for perhaps being a little <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4246816,00.html">biased</a>!!!!!! Of course, the "Torygraph" might have another reason!!!!! This interesting article hints that editors might have sided behind particular candidates because they <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4245712,00.html">hope to get knighthoods</a> from them when/if they become PM!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, I bet you never thought all this malarky might actually be due to Conservative party activists regressing their DNA to Cretacious Tertiary terms as a result of some people with long hair smoking a "French" cigarette in a field whilst listening to a "rave" with The Pink Floyd and Soft Machine in tha olden days!!!!!!!! But apparently it's really be the fault of the hippies in tha flowerpower era that the Tory party looks like a bunch of dinosaurs in tha new YK2 milleniumiunmimum!!!! U C, wot wiv the average age of Tories being around 63, apparently they <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/andreas_whittam_smith/story.jsp?dir=147&amp;story=90749&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">missed all that "counterculture" type stuff in the 60s</a>, and are supposedly too washed-up to understand Da Real World in 2001!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Call that an excuse!??!?!? I'm an old duffer, and I've not been left behind by the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, <i>or</i> Zeros-ies!!!! So put that in your pipe and smoke it- and inhale!!!!! Unless of course, you're a non-smoker.
