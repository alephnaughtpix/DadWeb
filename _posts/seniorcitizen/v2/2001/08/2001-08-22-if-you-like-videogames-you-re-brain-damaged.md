Well, this might not be of so much surprise to those who think that many games designers are themselves not exactly too full up in the intellectual department!!!!!!!! Apparently, some boffins have tested the braincells of kids play one game on an N64, and come to the surprising conclusion that it doesn't really stimulate the frontal lobe of one's mind in the same way as reading a book!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Well, so bloody wot, you might bawl!!!!! But apparently this is the <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/cn/20010820/tc/video_games_linked_to_brain_problems_1.html">beginning of the apocalypse</a> according to the boffins behind this study!!!!!!!! U C, the frontal lobe is the gubbins wot does <i>"play a crucial role in controlling behavior and in developing memory, emotion and learning"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">"There is a problem we will have with a new generation of children- who play computer games--that we have never seen before," he said. "The implications are very serious for an increasingly violent society, and these students will be doing more and more bad things if they are playing games and not doing other things like reading aloud or learning arithmetic."</div> <br/> <br/>Er, well, the implications might be very serious for "an increasingly violent society", except that statistics show that we don't really live in one!!!!!!! And, anyway, I don't need scientfic research to tell me that anyone who plays videogames <b>all</b> the time is a socially maladjusted moron!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, given that the kids were only playing a single game on a discontinued console system, couldn't it be possible that the lack of frontal lobe antics might have something to do with the kids being extremely bored?!??!?! In which case, maybe for the sake of future society, we should ban "Crossroads"?!?!?!??! (That would certainly get my vote, I can tell you!!!!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Anyway, if you think the above quote was a bit over-the-top, "sober" UK broadsheet <b>The Observer</b> comes on all "News Of The World" with the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4241769,00.html">same story</a>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote"><b>COMPUTER GAMES STUNT TEEN BRAINS</b> <br/> <br/>Hi-tech maps of the mind show that computer games are damaging brain development and could lead to children being unable to control violent behaviour.</div> <br/> <br/>Blimey!!!! So if crappy videogames are "damaging brain development", how do we explain what's happened to the folks in The Observer?!?!?!??!<br/> <br/>Still, probably the best <a href="http://www.plastic.com/comments.pl?sid=01/08/20/2215256&amp;cid=4">comment</a> on the subject was <br/> <br/><div class="usenet">They'll just grow up to be shitty gamereviewers who can't write. just like today's video game reviewers.</div>
