Well, if you like books filled with junkie Scots taking lots of drugs 'n' booze 'n' sex, and having a "square go" with each other, written in an prose style slightly less penetrable than their accents, then you're in luck!!!!!!!! The doyen of Jerry Springer meets William McIllvaney, <b>Irvine Welsh</b> is doing a sequel to <b>Trainspotting</b>, called <a href=""><b>Porno</b></a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And of course the Guardian is <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4243216,00.html">rolling over and going "diddums"</a> at the mere prospect!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Actually, Welsh is doing his darndest to update his portrayal of the just-outside-Edinburgh "town" where it's set, Leith, (It's so "just-outside" that you could walk down a road in built-up area of Edinburgh and suddenly, without any warning, you're in Leith!!!!!!!!!!) because it's starting to get a bit yuppified!!!!!!!!!! <i>"There's bits from London, Amsterdam, San Francisco and the south of France as well, but it's mainly Leith, which is more interesting anyway,"</i> Which is just as well, because the portrayal of Leith in that movie was complete and utter shit!!!!!!!!!! For the record, I actually lived in Leith for nearly a year, and only got mugged by junkies once!! And they weren't wearing any cool clothes!!! And there wasn't any sleazy 70s Glam-rock playing in the background, either!! As I said to the doctor who did my stitches, that director Danny Boyle has a lot to answer for!!!!<br/> <br/>Tho, <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/text_only.cfm?id=101677">not all Scottish writers</a> are pleased!!!!!! One Ronald Frame attacked the <i>"cliched brand of novels celebrating such dark subjects as cannibalism, necrophilia and sado-masochism"</i>!!!!!!!!!! And Kenneth White attacked certain unnamed novelists, comparing their "grittier-than-thou realism" to the <i>"remains of last night's fish supper, sauced up with sordid naturalism"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Actually, they might have a point!!!!!!!!! How come <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_08_19_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5194514">Chris Morris</a> gets toasted by the sections of the media for his recent show, but Welsh gets celebrated (usually by the same people!!!!) for his <i>"lets-have-a-laff-about-working-class-schemies-having-drugs-and-sex"</i> novels?!?!?!?! Actually, I think I know the answer to that one- they're a bunch of snobby middle-class idiots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
