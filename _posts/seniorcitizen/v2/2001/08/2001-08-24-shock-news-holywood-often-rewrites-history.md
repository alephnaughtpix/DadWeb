Apparently some folks in the wooly brigade broadsheet <b>The Guardian</b> have just found out that Hollywood movies often <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,539436,00.html">rewrite history</a> with a pro-US slant!!!!!!!!!! (Why nobody has thought of doing it the <a href="http://www.plastic.com/comments.pl?sid=01/08/23/0159252&amp;cid=32">other way around</a> is beyond me!!!!!!!!!! Especially if it's some like <a href="http://www.csfanpage.co.uk/series-three.htm"><b>The Comic Strip</b></a> doing the honours.... )<br/> <br/>Well, I never!!!!!!!! Next, we'll be finding out that even US webpubs are getting cheesed off at films <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2000/07/03/patriot/print.html">comparing the British to the Nazis</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
