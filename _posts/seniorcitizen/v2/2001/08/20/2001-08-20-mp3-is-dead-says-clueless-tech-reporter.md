Crikey!!!!! Apparently MP3 is dead!!!!! It must be, because Napster is dead!!!!! At least, so says this hilariously badly written <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/features/story.jsp?story=89394">article</a>, which seems to think Gnutella is somehow MP3-free, and that lovely little services like <a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.mojonation.com/">this</a> and even legit stuff like <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">this</a> don't exist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Apparently while we've all been listening to our spangly "O-Town vs Anal C@%t vs DJ Blobhead Going Mental In A Sample Editor 'Tuff UK Garage' Mix" mp3s, there's actually been a battle in the corporate world between Microsofts WMA format and Realaudio's erm, Realaudio format for subscription audio listening stuffs!!!!! They also make some strange mention of people not being too keen on paying for music they've already bought!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Erm...!!!! I can see some problems with this "business model" straight away!!!!!!!!! That's even before the vaguely interesting mention of antitrust "inquiries" against the services!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Hmmm... Maybe the record companies really need all those miscreants trading MP3s after all!!!! To show that they still have competition!!!!! And you can bet that our reporter Mr Haig will be saying at said juncture: <i>"You might have thought MP3s died with Napster- but you were wrong!!!!!!!!"</i> Speak for yourself, Haig!!! You're about as "with it" as your former Conservative leader namesake!!!!!!!!!! Ahem, where was I?!?!?!?
