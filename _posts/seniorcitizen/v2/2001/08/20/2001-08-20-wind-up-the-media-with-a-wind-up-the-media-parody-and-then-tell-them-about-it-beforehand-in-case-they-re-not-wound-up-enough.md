Well, if "Mr Moral" IDS does get elected, it might be AOK if you want to get him morally PO'd PDQ!!!! So it could be a great 4 years for certain "satire" type folks who might want to knee him in his morals!!!!! And talking of which, no doubt even people on the furthest reaches of this great big onion (by which I mean of course, the Earth, not a literal great big onion!!!!!!!! That would be really nuts!!!!!!!!!!) must know about the <a href="http://www.plastic.com/tv/01/07/30/144228.shtml">media stink</a> caused in reaction to Chris Morris' "Brass Eye" satire/edgy/alternative television show!!!! Indeed you're probably sick of hearing people saying <i>"Oh isn't it funny that Mr Morris has provoked exactly the sort of media craptalk session that his show satirised!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, it might actually be funnier than that!!!! According to this little seen entry in the Scotsman Media Diary a few weeks before the broadcast, (Scroll down to the headline "<b>OK Chris, you got us</b>") when the Daily Mail got enough information about the show in order to make "Recommended TV Show Of The Day" on Thursday, and "The Sickest TV Show Ever?" on Friday, that they might got their information indirectly from a rather unusual source: <b><a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/text_only.cfm?id=88568">Chris Morris himself</a></b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (!!!!!!!!!)
