Maybe the unfortunate fellow in the story above should have emigrated to Holland before calling the newspaper!!!!!! Because a <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/features/story.jsp?dir=86&amp;story=89393&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">humungous hacker festival</a> has happened there!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently there was a lot of talk about "laptop" and "wireless" hacking. Arg!!!! Does that mean that they can now hack my wireless, and make it tune itself to Radio Luxembourg!??!?!?! And how on Earth will they hack into the top of my lap!??!?!?!? Sounds a tad painful if you ask me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
