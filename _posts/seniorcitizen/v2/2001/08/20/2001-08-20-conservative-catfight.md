Talking of which!!!!!!!! The former El Prez De La UK Tories has given his backing to Iain Duncan-Smith in the Conservative leadership battle, which to be honest is a little bit like Richard Madely paying tribute to the talents of Roland Rat!!!!!!!! Just in case he wins, and you're all worried about the bother of having to say "Conservative Leader Iain Duncan-Smith" all the time, don't worry- he's got a "Nice" nickname: <b>IDS</b>!!!!!!!!! Given that he appears to be ahead in the race at the mo, it looks like Her Majesty's Official Opposition will be lead by someone who sounds more like one of those treatments one gets at hospital for a rare tropical disease!!!!!!!!! The other choice is an old fat bloke (Kenneth Clarke- or "Ken" Clarke as he seems to be called now!!!!) who knows how to run the economy, but is disliked by most MPs in his own party!!!!! There was a third one by the name of Portillo, but he got voted out by the MPs for being too namby-pamby!!!! And now his supporters are even going on about the Tories getting <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?dir=62&amp;story=89631&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">even less popular than the Liberal-Democrats</a>, led by "Cheeky Chappy" Charlie Kennedy!!!!!! (Not that <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/story.jsp?dir=141&amp;story=89538&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">some people</a> think this a bad thing!!!!!!!)<br/> <br/>All in all, it looks like the former "natural party of government" (Wot!??!?! Like, by genetics!??!?!) seems as cracked up as it's former female PM!!!!!!!! Mind you, it's not all laughs- there are also some really funny bits!!!!!!!!!!! Especially as some of the Conservative minded newspaper columnists start breaking ranks and pitch in for a particular candidate and trash the other one whilst trying to remain "objective" and deploring "backbiting"!!!!!!! Today's little beauty is from one <b>Bruce Anderson</b>, who claims to have been once a "<a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=69470&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">deluded Marxist revolutionary</a>", and is now presumably a deluded Conservative instead!!!! Well, at least if his <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=42024&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">bizzare</a> but <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=62846&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">hilarious</a> <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=71967&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">predictions</a> about the Tories <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=74901&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">giving Labour a close-run race</a> at the last election, and it's <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=60903&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">aftermath</a> are anything to go by!!!!!!!! Anyway, he's telling whatever Conservative party members read his columns to go for IDS, after spending an entire article <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=89543&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">trashing Ken Clarke</a>!!!!!!! (Not bad, considering who he <a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/bruce_anderson/story.jsp?dir=149&amp;story=77326&amp;host=6&amp;printable=1">originally supported</a>...)<br/> <br/>Mind you, it's not just the Tories!!! One fat-lipped former Labour heavyweight (Literally- almost!!!!) is getting a bit merry about various policy think-tanks that seem to be surprising the Labour govt by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,539591,00.html">completely disagreeing with them</a>!!!!!!
