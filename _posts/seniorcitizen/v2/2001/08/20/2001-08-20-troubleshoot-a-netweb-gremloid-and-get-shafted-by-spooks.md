Honestly!!!! I often wonder if the real reason our US-ian cousins are so "Big" on this Freedom of Speach malarky is that it makes it easier to shoot the messenger!!!!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Take this example!!!!!!!!! Some techie dude in an InterNetWeb SuperProvider noticed that a local newspaper w3sitey, run by a rival ISP, could be edited using Frontpage on a normal home PC compute- even if it was connected to tha SupeyDupey Inphoway Hi-Pipe with a really old (28.8K!!!!!!!) modem transceiver with one of those "acoustic couplings" with big suckers you stuck your 1970s phone handset into!!!!!!!!! (As opposed to other "couplings" where you stick something rather different in!!!!!!! But that's completely irrelevant to this story!!!!)<br/> <br/>So, he kindly informed the newspaper of the whopping great big hole in their editorial quality control, netweb-wise!!!!!! Then he <a href="http://www.linuxfreak.org/post.php/08/17/2001/134.html">gets arrested by the FBI</a> for some reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>As usual, it's starting the usual paranoid "guns/freedom" type debate in <a href="http://www.plastic.com/comments.pl?sid=01/08/19/1719259&amp;cid=15">some circles</a>!!!!!!!! But I can tell you this, FBI peeps!!!!!! Next time I'm in the US, and I spot some dire security bug in the FBI's server which allows the FBI site to be edited via SpanglyW3Editor v0.2342242b on tha desktop, don't worry, I won't inform you lot- in order to save FBI time and resources!!!!!! You'll be needing that to track down all those hacker types re-editing the pages to "<code>FBI suckxzkzz!!!!!111</code>", won't you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
