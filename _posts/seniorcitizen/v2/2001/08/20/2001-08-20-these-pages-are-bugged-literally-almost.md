Well, of course, w3pagez with bugz are not exactly amongst the most unexpected of problems encountered by the average w3surfa!!!!! In fact, it's extremely common for one to go to a page and have some alert flashing "Javascript Fatal Error XXVVXVII in line 4321563456" just because some prannet doesn't know how to set up their jazzy "mouseover" script!!!!!!!!! (And I bet the mice are pretty cross too, at having to hang around the website whilst the script is getting "debugged"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) But here's one "bug" that's not obviously apparent- because it's 1x1 pixels in size!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yes, this is apparently called a "<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/features/story.jsp?dir=86&amp;story=89392&amp;host=3&amp;printable=1">bug</a>"- or a tracking 1x1 invisible .gif file which can send and receive cookies for the usual "consumer profiling" so beloved by the idiot ad banner mob!!!!!!! Hang on a mo, isn't this extremely (as in 2 or 3 years) old news?!?!?!? I mean, ad banners and "web trackers" have been doing the same thing for yonks!!!! Why is it important now it's 1 pixel in size!?!??!! Because it's less easy to see?!?!?! Well, it's not as though you can't get webpages to track visitors without any graphics whatsoever- any big company can simply get their pages to track users at the server side level!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>And hasn't the word "bug" already been used anyway?!?!?! Sounds like this version of "bug" was coined by some technophobic sub-editor who, when he books a flight online then catches a cold after the flight, wants to do a new front-page investigation on the problem of "viruses"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
