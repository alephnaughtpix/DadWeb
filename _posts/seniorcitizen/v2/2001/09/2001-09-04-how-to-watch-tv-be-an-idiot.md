Cripes!!!!!!! Even the folks in US-land are getting a bit hot under the collar about tha tellybox!!!!!!!! Accordingly to this angry young man, to watch the Tube (By which we of course mean tha Tellybox, not the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_461000/461677.stm">ancient 80s beat music show </a>on Channel Four!!!!!!!!!!!!), one must:<br/><ul><li>Have an extremely short term memory!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><li>Believe everything one sees on tha tellybox!!!!!<br/><li>Ignore the ads!!!!!!!!!!!!! (?!?!?!? Isn't that a bit off-putting to advertisers!??!?!?)</li></li></li></ul> <br/>Well, OK, you might bawl, that was hardly rocket science!!!!!!!!! And maybe that is exactly the point!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe the writer's watched too much telly!!!!!
