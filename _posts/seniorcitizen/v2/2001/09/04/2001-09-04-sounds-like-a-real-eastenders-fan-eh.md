<i>"I am not the only person to question the wisdom of the BBC's decision to put EastEnders on three times a week."</i> says the Guardian's on-the-ball TV "correspondant" <b><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4242536,00.html">Charlotte Raven</a></b>!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Erm, I'm not entirely sure about that!!!!!!! In fact, most people would be questioning the wisdom of the popular BBC soap expanding to <b>four</b> days a week from it's existing format of three a week, which is what it's been doing for flipping yonks!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Wot next!??!?! <i>"I'm sure I'm not the only person to question whether this new fangled CD thingy will ever become as popular as 8-tracks cartidges!!!!!!"</i>?!??!?!?!?
