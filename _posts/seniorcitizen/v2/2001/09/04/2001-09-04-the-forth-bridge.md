Did U know tha Forth Road Bridge, that big suspsension bridge over some Scottish river next to the huge exoskeleton that is the <a href="http://www.higsonhall.free-online.co.uk/forth.html">Forth Rail Bridge</a>, wot featured in Hitchcock's "39 Nine Steps", was opened today in 1964 by Her Majesty!!!!!!!! (By which I mean of course The Queen, not Prince Florian Wolfgang Von Stusselhauffen IV as you may think!!!!!!!) And anyway what happened to the other three road and rail bridges!?!??!?!
