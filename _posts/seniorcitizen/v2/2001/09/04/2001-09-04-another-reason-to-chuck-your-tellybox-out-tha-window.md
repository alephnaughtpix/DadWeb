I don't believe this!!!!!!!!! OK, fair enough, <b>Johnny Vaughn</b> was probably the best presenter of UK TV CH4's "Big Breakfast" proggy- on tha tellybox!!!!!!! (Which is quickly scrabbling back to it's original format after a disasterous revamp!!!!!) But why someone has thought he'd be really great trying his hand at <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/21-8-19101-0-23-7.html">sitcoms</a> is anyone's guess!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Even worse, ITV seem to have got into their heads that what viewers really want is yet another bloody costume drama based on one of DIcken's tomes!!!!!!! In this case, it's <b><a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/22-8-19101-0-9-38.html">Mr Micawber</a></b>, from the Pickwick Papers, but it's virtually guaranteed to be some hammily acted overcooked costume disaster!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>The way things are going, it's not like one has to worry about the quality of digital telly these days, as the analogue stuffs seems to even worse!!!!!!!
