Interestingly, the above article advances the interesting the UK indie shies away from reality, whilst US pop embraces it!!!!! So no doubt, the young whippersnapper Harris will be a bit miffed to learn that a certain MTV show might not exactly be following reality!!!!! It seems that certain miscreants at Interscope, record label to shouty metal beat combo <b>Limp Bizkit</b> and angry rappy chappy <b>Eminimeinimeineimeininem</b>, have been sending missives on their NetWeb MailyList to the effect that <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/08/28/trl/print.html">one should vote for their combos</a> as much as poss on MTV's <b>Total Request Live</b> w3site!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Well, I never!!!!!! Next, they'll be telling me some record companies pay good money to make DJ peeps play their latest gramophones on tha radiogram!!!!!!!!!!! Is nothing sacred?!?!??!?!?
