In the meantime!!!! While you're looking out to sea, waiting for tha <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_08_26_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5365781">big tsumaiamaini</a> to give New York a thorough wash-up, what you might not know is that the mass of liquid H<sub>2</sub>0 in which your eyeballz are trained is might be signposted <i>"Warning!!! Extreme Ocean Mining Ocean No. 3!!!!!"</i> in future!!!!!!!!!!!! And it's all thanks to a "lovely" bloke- literally!!!!!!! <br/> <br/>Now I bet you didn't you know this, but when you go to <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~ceo/bridlington/">Bridlington</a>, <a href="http://www.whitbytourism.com/">Whitby</a> or <a href="http://www.skegness.net/">Skegness</a>, apparently when you take a paddle (or piddle, as I sometimes do!!!!!!!!!!!) in tha big blue (By which I of course mean, the sea, not IBM!!!!!!!!!!!) that there could be molecules of dissolved gold under yur toenails!!!!! This is because the dissolved versh of the valuable yellow shiny stuff (Gold, not sulphur as you may think!!!!!!!!!!) is apparently readily available in tha big C- in dissolved form!!!!!!!! And the only reason <a href="http://www.yorkshirecoast.co.uk/scarb/">Scarborough</a> still looks like a dump, and not like Las Vegas, is that it's a bit hard to convert the dissolved versh into the non-dissolved versh wot you put in your lovley trinkets!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Until now that is!!!!!!!! A Umich Prof with the wonderful name <b>Derek Lovley</b> has found microbacteria called <b>Extremophiles</b> which can <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,46197,00.html">turn dissolved gold into solid gold</a>!!!!!!!!!!! Unfortunately it's early days, and <i>"Lovley says the process isn't efficient enough to interest jewelry makers, since it would take about a million microbes to generate a gram of solid gold dust."</i>!!!!!!!! Erm, like, why not just use a million of them then!??!?!! It's not as though they're going to take up too much space, is it!??!?!?! Unless of course, they're as big as Norman Tebbit!!!!!!!!
