Megathanx to <b>Diana</b> who emailed to say that the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_09_02_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5477746">mysterious quote</a> apparently from a stand-up comedian, actually probably was from a stand-up comedian!!! And the comedian was probably the very wonderful <b>Steven Wright</b>!!!! Not to be confused with the very wonderful <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/steve_wright/"><b>Steve Wright In The Afternoon</b></a> of course.
