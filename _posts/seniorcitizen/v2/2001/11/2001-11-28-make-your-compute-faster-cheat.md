You know how it feels!!!!! Or maybe you don't!!!!!!! OK then, you can imagine how it feels!!!!!! Or maybe you can't!!!!!! But, anyway, if you can, you know how it feels!!!!!!!!!! Especially when you make bits of the insides for your PeeCee compute thingy!!!!!<br/> <br/>Take for example, <b>ATI</b>, who made their lovely new videogram card for da PeeCee, and said it was really suped-dupey because it played Quake II faster than other cardz!!!!!! Then someone found out that when you rename Quake III to a different filename, it isn't faster!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yep, you guessed it, the driver files for the card recognise the filename for Quake III, and slightly downgrade all the phung shading and texture raytracey bits so that it runs faster!!!!! And for some odd reason, some people are <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,48577,00.html">more than a little miffed at this</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
