I'd better remember the title of the tune and the group so I can tell all my friends to boycott it!!!!!!"</i>!??!??!?!?!? I know I have!!!!!!! The only problem is, the DJ usually goes: <i>"And that was <font size="-3">[mumble mumble]</font> by <font size="-3">[mumble mumble]</font>. And next..."</i>!!!!!!!!!!! Bah!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But in the spangly future when we're all wearing cheesy silver jumpsuits (Just like in "Buck Rodgers in the 25th Century"!!!!!!!!! Bidibidibidi... etc. !!!!) it might be different!!!!!!!

You couldn't exactly phone it up on the egg-whisk, could you!!!!! That would be really stupid!!!!!!!!) and place tha phone receiver to the radio for a few seccys- and it'll <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991619">tell you wot you are listening to</a>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Only prob!!!!
