U-no how some daft tabloidy hacks like using the word "literally" a lot?!?!? Stuff like:<br/> <br/><div class="usenet">"Literally all kinds of cars are at this motor show!!!!!!" [Wot!!! Even Reliant Robins?!?!??!]<br/> <br/>"Literally everyone who was anyone was at this film premiere!!!!!" [Wot, like, did they dig up Perry Como so he could go along as well?!??!?!]<br/> <br/>"This funky chune is literally a classic!!!!!!!!!!" [Wot, like Jane Austen or sometihng!??!?!?!?]</div> <br/> <br/>And so on!!!!!!!! Well, according to <a href="http://www.robertfulford.com/literally.html">this bloke</a>, such people are a bunch of planks!!!!!! Literally!!!!!! (Well, not really- but they <i>are</i> as thick as two short ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!) In any, it would be safe to say they are literally a bunch of cretins!!!!!!!!
