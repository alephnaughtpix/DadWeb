Well, <b>Jack McConnell</b> is now First Minister of the country wot I live in (Scotland!!!!! Not England, as some of you geographically challenged people might think!!!!!!! Actually, "geographically challenged" sounds like someone who is restricted in a geographical sense, and therefore might not be the most appropriate appelation at this juncture!!!!!! Unless of course you happen to be in prison!!!! Or you're in the US, have a slightly darker skin colour, and can speak other languages in addition to English!!!!!!!!! But in latter case, if you're educated enough to know more than one language, the chances are that you might be educated enough to know that Scotland and England are not the same flipping country!!!!!! Erm, where was I??!?!?!?) Oh yes!!!! McConnell!!!!! Comes across as a very nervous man, as tho he's manager of <b><a href="http://www.ptfc.net/">Partick Thistle Football Club</a></b>!!!!!!!! (Or, as those who look at the tellybox scoreboard call it, "Partick Thistle Nil"!!!!!!!!!!!!!) But in the first couple of hours of being Top Scot Dog, he done away with 5 ministers from his cabinet!!!!!!! (Which is a jolly odd place to keep them if you ask me!!!!! Shouldn't they be in an office or something!??!??!) But it's even worse, according to this <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/mcwhirter/archive/28-11-19101-22-43-2.html">"analysis" article</a>: <br/> <br/><div class="quote">When Jack McConnell said there wouldn't be a night of the long knives he was right. This reshuffle was more like the St Valentine's Day massacre. Just when we thought we were in for a period of consolidation under the new first minister, suddenly there is blood all over the cabinet table and there are bodies lying on the steps of Bute House. Jack McConnell decided that he needed to impose his authority over a sometimes fractious ministerial team by the most ruthless means.</div> <br/> <br/>Crikey!!!!!!! Talk about Mr Dangerous!!!!!! Let's hope Georgy W doesn't decide to defend America against terrorism by straegically nuking Edinburgh!!!!!! That would really ruin the area!!!!! There wouldn't be any decent pubs left for a start!!!!!!!!
