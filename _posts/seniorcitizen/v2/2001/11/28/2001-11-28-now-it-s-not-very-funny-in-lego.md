Now, this is a bit sad!!!!!! We've already mentioned people doing really sad things with Lego, like <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_10_22_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1176003">Lego album covers</a> and <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_01_07_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1905987">Lego video nasties</a>!!!!!!! But now Lego themselves have topped it all by merging one sad tradition with another to come up with what some folks might term to be "something completely different"!!!!!!!!! If they're complete pillocks!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Yes, I am of course talking about those young whippersnappers who decide to propel themselves up every right-thinking person's nostril by reciting sketches from Monty Python!!!!!!!!!! And the people who find it just as funny the 24 bazillionth time they've heard it!!!!!!!!!!! So wot do Lego do but give us, but <a href="http://www.lego.com/studios/screening/movie.asp?title=montypython"><b>Monty Python and the Holy Grail- The Lego Version</b></a>!!!!!!!!! I ask you!!!!!!!!! What is the world coming to?!?!??! <br/> <br/>Mind you, having though about it, maybe Lego are extracting tha urine in a very subtle way!!!!! After all the Lego People figures have a daft fixed grin- just like the prannets who re-enact Monty Python sketches 36 gazillion times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
