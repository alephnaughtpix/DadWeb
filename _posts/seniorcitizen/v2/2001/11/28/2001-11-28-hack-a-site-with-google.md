And especially, if like, you have tha supey-dupey browsey-wowsey <a href="http://www.opera.com/"><b>Opera</b></a>, you'll be using it all the time <a href="http://www.opera.com/startup/">for searching</a>!!!!!! But it looks like some people are also using it- for hacking!!!!! Apparently you can use Google to search for <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/23069.html">vunerable NetWeb pages</a>!!!!!!!!!
