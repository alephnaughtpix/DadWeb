Here I was, just coming back into society after a couple of months hard coding as part of a megabucks ultraflashy XML w3project for a booze company, and I find the world's suddenly changed in my absence!!!!!!! Not only have a bunch of idiots flown planes into a major symbol of world capitalism causing untold death and destruction, and both financial and political ructions, the US is getting awfully angry about everything and seriously endangering it's "Land of the Free" tagline, and everyone else is getting all panicky!!!!! And that's even before all that Anthrax malarkey!!!!!!!!! I was waiting at the bus stop yesterday, and coughed a bit- and suddenly everyone speedily donned gasmasks!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Honestly!!!!!! Do I have to hold all your hands or something??!?!??!? What you young whippersnappers need is a bit of fortitude or whatnot!!!!!! Things might be bad now, but you'll get through if you don't all go mad running around like decapitated poultry of the avian variety!!!!!!! And I should know, I've been through the Blitz!!!!!<br/> <br/>Maybe while Georgy W's still got high popularity ratings, he should rewrite that famous speech by Churchill!!!! (After all, he's ripped off <i>"Those who are not with us are against us"</i> from Jesus!!!!!!) You know the sort of thing: <i>"We shall fight them on the beaches, erm, of Khandahar..."</i> OK then, scratch that idea!!!!!!! Just bring back <b>Vera Lynn</b>!!!! It would be an improvement on Maria Carey, let's face it!!!!!!!!!!
