I suspect some young whippersnappers might not have read Charles Dicken's <i>"A Christmas Carol"</i>!!!!!! So, if you have to explain to them what it's about, don't go <i>"Oh you know!!!!!!!! It's the one with Scrooge in it!!!!!! You know!!!!!!!!! SCROOGE!!!!!!!! The miser!!!!!!!! It's set in the Victorian... Oh forget it, go and watch <a href="http://www.hollyoaks.com/"><b>Hollyoaks</b></a> then!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!! What you really should be saying is: <i>"It's about this guy called Scrooge, who's a bit like Lars Ullrich out of Metallica"</i>, and they'll immediately understand what you mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>That's because according to some legal boffin by the name of <b>Lawrence Lessig</b> says that todays equivalents of Scrooge are <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,48625,00.html">excessive "copyright hoarders"</a>!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Blimey!!!!!!! Does that mean <b>Napster</b> is Ghost of Xmas Past, and Bob Cratchit uses Gnutella/Musicity/Freenet/Ploppytrader?!?!?!?
