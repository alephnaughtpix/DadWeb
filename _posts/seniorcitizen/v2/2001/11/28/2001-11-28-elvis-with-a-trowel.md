Hmmmm... I would have thought people had stopped looking for an activity to be the "New Rock 'n' Roll" after "BritPop" was briefly the New Rock 'n Roll until someone realised that reheated rock 'n' roll actually wasn't really all that good!!!!!! But someone's still banging on about the New Rock 'n' Roll!!!!!! Which is, erm, <b><a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/columnists.cfm?id=125524">Landscape Gardening</a></b>!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>So know you can swivel your pelvis in Shea Stadium- whilst doing the weeding!!!!!!!!!! Maybe they could get the Queen Mum to swivel her hips- it should be easy for her, as she's had so many hip replacement operations, she can probably spin her pelvis around, like a spinning top!!!!!!
