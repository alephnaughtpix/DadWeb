Some people said my decision to return to doing SC (By which I of course mean the venerable organ wot you are reading- with your eyes!!!!! And by organ I of course mean this w3page, not a Bontempi or Hammond "Leslie" thingy!!!!!! I mean, what would you be able to read there!!!!! Well, OK, maybe the labels on the buttons, but that would be really stupid!!!!!!) Erm, anyway!!!!!!!! They said the act of moi el returno to <b>Senior Citizen</b> would be like entering a minefield- literally!!!!!!!! I said: <i>"Don't be so flipping stupid!!!! I have no plans to go anywhere near Afghanistan!!!!!"</i> <br/> <br/>Having said that, you can get a flavour of the unfortunate predicament of the Afghanis without risk to life and limb- by playing a game in Windoze!!!!!!!! Yes, I am of course talking about <b>Minesweeper</b>, the classic WinTelApp in which you randomly click at blank grey square until you die, or, if you're really good, carefully analyse each result in order to pick the next square to click, then when you have to make a guess, randomly click a square and die!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>But if you're playing Minesweeper as a sustained political thought experiment on the morality of landmines, what else do you play for fun?!?!?! Yes, that's right <b>Freecell</b>, the barely penetrable Windoze "card" game!!!!!! Until now!!!!!!! Yes, now there's a <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/">Freecell</a> solver program!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Now all we need is a "Minesweeper Solver", and show those US military folks in Afghanistan how to do it!!!!!!!!!
