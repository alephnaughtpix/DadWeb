Nope!!!!!!!! I'm not talking about <a href="http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/"><b>Sinclair Spectrums</b></a> here!!!!!!!!!! Or even PCees minus tha sound-o-gram card!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about mobile phones!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Wot!!!!!! You didn't know mobile phones could crash!!!!!!! Well, apparently they can, and can do by merely receiving a text msg!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yep, it's another <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/23080.html">bizzare tecchy security exploit</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Lucky it doesn't work on my phone!!!!!! But then again, that's because my phone's so ancient!!!!! I call people on it in town, and folks come up and ask me why I've stuck my laptop to my cranium!!!!!!!!!!!
