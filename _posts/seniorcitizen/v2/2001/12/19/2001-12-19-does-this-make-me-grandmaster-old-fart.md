This is interesting!!!!!!!! Some bloke is giving us a a potted history of the early days of hip-hop, and then at the end of it says it's <a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/tdcrc/read/message.html?mid=1605688017&amp;sort=d&amp;start=40" title="'Time to break out your old Sugar Hill Gang records', apparently!!!!!!!!">a bit like weblogging</a>, really!!!!!!!! Quite exactly how it's similar isn't really explained tho!!!!!!! But apparently <i>"Much like blogging, rap depended upon a long history, but somehow- in an almost undescribable way- [Well, certainly for the purposes of this article, there's no 'almost' about it!!!!!] seemed <b>different</b>."</i>!!!!!!!!!! Which probably means blogging's a bit like <a href="http://www.ncbookstore.com/music/skiffle.htm" title="And you can't get much more different than Skiffle can you?!??!?!?">Skiffle</a> as well!!!!!!!!!!
