See <a href="http://www.ntl.co.uk/" title="Hello NTL peeps!!!!">NTL</a>?!?!?!? U-no, the UK cable folks wot do the cable tellybox wires up my end!!!!! They used to do quaint "local" ads on their channels for things like tha Greasy Spoon Caff on Bollokshaws Road,  Kirkintilloch, where you would get some faded photoshots of some of my friends from down tha Old Folks Home eating a chip butty!!!!! With some 'Pumpin' house chunes from some "library music" CD done by a company from Swindon!!!!! And some funny woman does a voiceover through her nose!!!!!!!! And she says something muffled like: <i>"Why not come along to the Greasy Spoon Caff, at 18573  Bollokshaws Road,  Kirkintilloch??!?!?"</i> At which point we shout: <i>"Because you'll die of Botulism, that's why!!!!!!"</i> <br/> <br/>Ahem, anyway!!!!!! They stopped that!!!!! Now they do digital tellybox thingymajiggies which also allow you to surf tha megamighty NetWeb InphoPipeWay on the world's crappest w3browsa!!!! It's like an Anti-<a href="http://www.opera.com/" title="Downloaddy Opera browsey-wowsey el pronto!!!! Like, now!!!!">Opera</a>!!!!!!!!! In fact, it's so far from the user experience of Opera, it might as well be called tha <b>Robert Plant Browsey-wowsey</b>!!!!!! Certainly it's slow enough that you can imagine the long haired ruffian from Led Zeppelin wailing <i>"Wahahahrglhglgll... Push!!! Push!!!! Baybee, babybee, baybee!!!!! etc."</i>, like he did in that duffoid "Song Remains The Same" cinematic "experince", in order to fill in the time before anything actually gets done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Woops, where was I?!?!?!? Oh yes, NTL, the company wot gave us the catchphrase <i>"Technology Tamed"</i> look set to be tamed themselves- by tha Banks!!!!! Yep, they've got into the "red" in monetary terms!!!! (Wot, like they've become Communist?!?!?!??!) And now the Banks are going to <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,620042,00.html" title="Honestly!!!!! Look, it says so in the Guardian Media section, so it must be true!!!!!!!">take them over</a>!!!!!!!!!! By which I presume they mean their bank people wot they do banking with!!!!!!! And no the family of <b>Jeff Banks</b>, the fashion designer!!!!!!!!!!! That would be really stupid!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, what would they do, apart from doing "<a href="http://www.clotheshow2001.com/" title="Crikey!!!! It would help if they were actually *wearing* them!!!!!!">The Clothes Show</a>- channel!!!!"?!?!??!?!
