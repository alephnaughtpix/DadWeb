I must admit to being rather amused (in the laughter sense!!!) when I read this story: <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/30-11-19101-0-28-10.html"><b>"'Wee Free' Church accused of giving christianity a bad name"</b></a>!!!!!!<p>No wonder!!!!! They definately are given them a bad name!!!!! I mean, can you possibly give Christians a dafter name than <i>"Wee Frees"</i>?!??!?!?!?!?!? I think not!!!!!!!!!</p>
