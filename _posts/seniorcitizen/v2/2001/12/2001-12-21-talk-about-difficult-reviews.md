But even I didn't expect to see in <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2001/" title="2001: a Perl Odddessy!!!!">this article</a>, a review of  <b>Prefuse 73</b>'s elpee, which went like this:<br/><div class="quote">"+87aZ{{skZixmZRJ+tbeatBY[:%?F&amp;6&amp;*;11))!!kccZRR<br/>{{kkscc1î{cRRasmMRMJCACD<br/>?IE)W\7;.-4%&amp;/,51($$(6"</div> <br>... and that's just the first line!!!
