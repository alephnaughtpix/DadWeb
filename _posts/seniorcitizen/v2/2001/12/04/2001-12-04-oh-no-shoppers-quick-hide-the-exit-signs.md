U-no, once I went into this rather large shop!!!!!! And I while I was looking for tha longjohns, I found myself lost in the hosiery section!!!!!!!! A mistake anyone could have made, as I said to the police officer!!!!!! But it would have been even worse if the shop had been run the peeps who run the shops in this article!!!!! That's because they would have removed the "Exit" signs!!!!!! At least, that's what they've done in their <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,609623,00.html">Online Shopps</a>!!!!!!!
