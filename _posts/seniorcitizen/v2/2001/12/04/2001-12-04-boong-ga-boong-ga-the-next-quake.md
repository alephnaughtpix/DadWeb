What would you do if someone comes up to and pokes you in the eye?!??!?! Would you kick the "shit" of said personage?!?!?!? Nope!!!! What you would actually do is say <i>"Aha!!!! You've been playing the latest in cult Japanese video games!!!!!"</i> And then proceed to kick the "shit" out of said personage!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>That's because the latest in Far East video games action is a game by the name of <b>Boong-Ga Boong-Ga</b>, in which you <a href="">poke someone in tha fizzog</a>!!!!!! (By which I course mean the "face", not a "sherbet fountain"!!!!!! That would be really silly!!!! Or maybe not!!!! Maybe this person likes a bit of sherbet!!!!! OK I'll shut up now!!!!!!)
