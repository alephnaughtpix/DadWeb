  Well, to be honest, I didn't know my tootsies were that small!!!!!! By which     I of course mean my <b>ecological footprint</b> as found by this <a href="http://www.lead.org/leadnet/footprint/intro.htm">spiffy    site</a>!!!!! Despite the apparently "leading" questions, I still     managed to score the following:<br/> <br/><div class="usenet"><pre><b>YOUR RESULTS: </b><br/>Food Footprint: 1.8 hectares or 4.5 acres <br/>Transportation Footprint: 0.6 hectares or 1.5 acres <br/>Housing Footprint: 0.6 hectares or 1.6 acres <br/>Other Footprints: 1.1 hectares or 2.8 acres <br/>Total Footprint: per person 4.2 hectares or 10.4 acres <br/><b>IN COMPARISON:</b> <br/>Your Eco-Footprint measures 41.2 % of an average <br/>American Footprint. <br>Worldwide, the biologically productive space available per <br/>person is 2.2 hectares or 5.4 acres.</br></pre></div><br/><br/>Well, OK, I'm not quite at the "biologically productive" level     yet- tho certain individuals party to my antics in the bedroom department might  strongly disagree!!!!!
