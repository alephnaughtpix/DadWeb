Apparently, Scotland has a good reputation for it's education!!!!!! Wot a shame some of our local political folk don't avail themselves of it a bit more!!!!!!! Presumably they are of the opinion, in the sage words of a certain local councillor, that <i>"a leopard cannae change it's horses midstream!!!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Still, you'd expect some enobled gent to at least know a few things about nursery rhymes!!!!!!! According to <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/22-1-19101-0-28-10.html">this story</a>:<br/><br/><div class="quote">"He [Henry MacLeish] has marched us to the top of the hill on this. People would take it remiss if he marched us down again," said Sir Stewart Sutherland</div><br/><br/>Erm, well, if Mr MacLeish is genuinely being likened to The Grand Old Duke of York, then people would in fact "take it remiss" if he failed to follow in the Duke's footsteps and march down tha hill, only to repeat said up/down manouvere numerous times!!!!! Unless of course Mr MacLeish is not supposed to follow the Duke's example, in which case, the comparision is completely irrelevent, until such time as he were to echo the movements of the Grand Old Duke of York!!!!!! But given that such an eventuality is in the future, then it's a bit of a waste of time, really!!!!! Because... OK, I'll shut up now!!!!!!!!!!
