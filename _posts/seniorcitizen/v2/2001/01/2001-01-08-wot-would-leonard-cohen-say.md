Mind you, that's not the only case of mistaken memory in today's old fogey press!!!!!!! Some bloke called Fergal (tho he's no Sharkey!!!!!!!) is getting all wibbly about reaching 40 and feeling "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Fergal_Keane/keane060101.shtml">past it</a>"!!!!!! (You're only as old as you feel, young man!!!!!!!!) <br/><br/>Which is jolly ironic is he mentions in the article that he is <i>"40, still wearing Levi's and workshirts and listening to Neil Young and James Taylor and Joni Mitchell. And yes, from to time I even sneak a listen to Songs of Leonard Cohen: "I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel..." "</i> Which is of course complete crap, as said Leonard Cohen song does not in fact appear on the <i>Songs Of Leonard Cohen</i> album but the <i>New Skin For The Old Ceremony</i> album!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>See?!??!?! If a more mature man such as myself can remember such vital facts, then there's no excuse for some mere fortysomething to lose his memory cells!!!!!!!!!!
