So, how was your New Year!??!?! (Or "Hogmany", as we shout around these regions!!!!!!) I had an extremely good piss-up at the Old Folks Home party!!!!!!!!!!! And we had a right good sing-a-long, which broke a few windows!!!!!!! Mind you, it was far preferable to enduring <a href="http://ubl.artistdirect.com/fp2.asp?layout=artist_card&amp;artistid=152674&amp;p_id=P+++++5186"><b>The Proclaimers</b></a> on the increasingly rubbish tellybox Hogmany coverage!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>And we weren't the only ones to come to such an informed decision!!!!!!!! In fact, the entire non-TV Scottish media spent a couple of days <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/2-1-19101-0-18-22.html">slagging it off</a>, and taking a particular interest in the "glamourous" dress worn by the presenter of <b>BBC1</b>'s effort, <b>Jackie Bird</b>!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">John Davidson, The Herald's fashion director, speculated that Ms Bird was following in the perilously high-heeled footsteps of such tele-babes as Carol Vorderman. <br/><br/>But Ms Bird was having none of it. "My gingham, laced-top pinafore was at the cleaners and it was all I had in the wardrobe," she said. <br/><br/>"Anyway, I work damn hard to get into something like that and Hogmanay is the only time to wear it. Your fashion director should join the 21st century."</div><br/><br/>Some "marketing" student also makes some "naughty" comment!!! <i>"Anyone sad enough to stay in on Hogmanay deserves to be subjected to crap TV."</i> <br/><br/>Wooo!!!! How controversial!!!!!!! Mind you, I think it's a bit "off" to wish The Proclaimers and <a href="http://ubl.artistdirect.com/fp2.asp?layout=artist_card&amp;artistid=3218&amp;p_id=P+++++4043"><b>Deacon Blue</b></a> even on your worst enemies!!!!!! Still, this is a marketing student we're talking about here!!!!!!!!!!
