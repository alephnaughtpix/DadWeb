Remember when your old folks used to tell you bedtime stories?!?!??!?!? I know I do!!!!!!! Classic stories like Cinderella, Snow White, The St Valentines Day Massacre, and whatnot!!!!!!!! But it looks like there's one classic that one <i>won't</i> be able to read to one's progeny!!!!!!!!! According to the finding of this clever young chap, the newly published e-book version of Lewis Caroll's <b>Alice In Wonderland</b> has a rather unusual user license requirement- <a href="http://www.pigdogs.org/art/adobe.html">reading it aloud ain't allowed</a>!!!!!!!!! Presumably if you try it, you'll get "busted" by "fuzz"!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>No doubt <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_03_seniorcitizen_archive.html#784197">in future</a> this will lead to numerous children being drawn into a seedy underworld of "speakeasies" where they can listen to popular childrens books or something!!!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, I wouldn't want to be the equivalent of "Elliot Ness" in such an enviroment!!!!!!! If I had never touched a drop of illicit literature in my life, I would probably be about as intelligent as a Radio Clyde DJ!!!!!!!!!!!!
