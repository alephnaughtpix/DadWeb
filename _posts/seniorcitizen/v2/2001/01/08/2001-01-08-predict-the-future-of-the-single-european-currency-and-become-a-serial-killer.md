Here's an <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Simon_Carr/2001-01/carr080101.shtml">interesting declaration</a> from that brillibobs <b>Indie</b> scribe <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1731085">Simon "Two Brains" Carr</a>:<br/><br/><div class="quote">"The euro has already begun to strengthen against the dollar, and that will probably continue," said John Monks, the union leader, quite as if he knew what he was talking about. <br/><br/>The fact is, he doesn't know. The other fact is that nobody knows. And the last, most interesting fact is that nobody can know. Anyone who says they know is a salesman or a psycho.</div><br/><br/>Crikey!!!!! Imagine that!!!!!!!!!! Arthur Daley or Norman Bates advising governments on economic matters!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Just as well that this situation is a little unlikely!!!!! Especially given that they are fictional characters!!!!!!!!!!
