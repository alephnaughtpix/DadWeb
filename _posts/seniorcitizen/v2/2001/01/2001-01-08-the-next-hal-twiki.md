Well, now 2001 is upon is, it looks like there isn't too many years designated in any "significant" sci-fi book/movies coming up in the near future!!!!!!!!! Which is a jolly good thing if you ask me!!!!!!!! Because it means that we won't get any unoriginal rentaquote buffons pointing that such and such "predictions" made in some science fiction tale from "ninteen canteen" weren't really very good!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So how long have we got until the next "big" year?!?!?! According to this article, about 400 years!!!!!!!! That's because the next date in the "sci-fi calender" is <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/cfm/home/text_only.cfm?articleid=37540&amp;domain=www%2Ethescotsman%2Eco%2Euk&amp;pathinfo=%2Fcolumnists%2Ecfm&amp;qstring=id%3D37540&amp;navlevel2="><b>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</b></a>!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>BTW This article is notable for being written by someone who clearly doesn't actually remember watching Mr Glen "A" Larsons ground breaking <a href="http://www.buck-rogers.com/">tellybox serial</a>!!!!!!! All she seems to remember is that there was a robot called "Tweakey" who went "<a href="http://www.buck-rogers.com/media/bedebede.wav">Beagley, beagley</a>!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Maybe she's getting mixed up with <b><a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~kalel/k9.html">K9</a></b> or something!!!!!!!)
