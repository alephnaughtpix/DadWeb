Yikes!!!!!! Some folks have managed to work out how to <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010118/sc/stopping_light_3.html">"stop" light</a> using what they call "optical molasses"!!!!!!!!!!! <i>"It's as if you stretched a silk thread across a railroad track and a train vanishes into it"</i> said some bloke.<br/><br/>U-no, they would have of couse achieved such an objective quicker if they had followed <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/25.html#712">my suggestions</a> from an old ish of SC!!!!!!! And it would have been less expensive!!!!! Instead of using an expensive physics experiment, they could have just got <a href="http://www.diffusionuk.freeserve.co.uk/bob.htm">Bob The Builder</a> in!!!!!!!
