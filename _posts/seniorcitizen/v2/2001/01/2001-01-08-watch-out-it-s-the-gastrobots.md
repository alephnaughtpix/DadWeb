U-no, you might dimly remember the olden days when as a young sprite you were given dinner by your parents, and told to eat the savoury stuff before the sweets!!!!!!!!! Much as I would protest that it should be other way round, and serve sweet stuff before the crappy brussell sprouts, they wouldn't take any notice, instead giving some feeble excuse about the savoury stuff apparently being more essential and nutritious!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Well, now I can laugh in their faces!!!!!!! Well, not literally, obviously!!!!!! I'd have to dig them up first!!!!!!!! And there wouldn't be any faces left for me to laugh at!!!!!!!! But I'm sure they would turn in their graves at the mention of this next story!!!!!! Especially because the coffins were buried with inbuilt "grave rotation devices", which allows the corpses to safely turn 360 degrees in their graves when I press a special button on the mantlepiece in my Drawing Room!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Anyway!!!!!! The parental tyranny of "savoury before sweets" has finally been toppled by a "gastrobot"!!!!!!! Nope, we're not talking about a snail with a tummy ache!!!!!!!!! In fact, we're talking about a robot- which <a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_gear.html">lives on sugar</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So if you're making a cup of tea for this chap, remember to put at least 3 spoonfulls of sugar in it!!!!!!!!!!!
