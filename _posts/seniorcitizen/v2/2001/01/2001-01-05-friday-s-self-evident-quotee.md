"It takes two to make a marriage a success and only one a failure"<br/>- Lord Herbet Samuel [Well, obviously!!!!!! I mean a marriage with only one person is obviously not exactly going to work is it?!?!?!?! Unless you're really egotistical, obviously!!!!!!! Er, hang on, am I being too obvious!??!?!? OK, I'd better be careful here before I use up my "obvious" quota, and ... Oh no!!!!!! I've just used it up there!!!!!! Now I'll have to wait for a fresh delivery before I can use the word "_______" again!!!!!!!! (Note to self: upon delivery, fill in blanks with "_______"!!!!)]
