Crikey!!!!!! The new epoch of digital audio has finally arrived, and I didn't realise it!!!!!!! This is truly a Big Day for tha NetWeb!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Wot do you mean <i>"Oh calm down, you silly old man!!!!"</i>?!??!? OK, here's the story... Wot with Napster going all fee-paying, and also due  to the fact that, thanks to Napster's not-very-user-friendly interface, one can download a file called "<code>BRITN~1.MP3",</code>  and listen to it, and hear some crap "alternative" band from "Austin" do a really dire song called something like "Britney Sucks!!!!!!" type nonsense, I've been looking for an alternative Nappy clone that's much better!!!!!! <br/> <br/>So here's a jolly nice one called called <b><a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/">Audiogalaxy</a></b>!!!!!!! You just download a nice little <a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/satellite/">P2P     client</a>, and let their spiffy w3site interface do the rest!!!!! Even better     it recognises the ID3 tags on mpeggies, and keeps track of identical copies of files, so as to allow for sensible distribution of popular files!!!! There's also a growing database of songs and artists which can allow you to find even not-so-popular stuffs!!!<br/> <br/>Anyway, that's by the by- what's really exciting is that the Audiogalaxy "satellite" has finally passed the "<b>Grandad Test</b>"!!!! Yes!!!! As postulated in an <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/6.html#186">early issue</a> of SC, the Grandad Test was a measure of how mainstream NetWeb audio    file distribution had become!!!! Now we know that file-swapping has truly     hit the big time, when you can now get a copy of <b><a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/list/song.php?&amp;g=1153683">"Grandad" by Clive Dunn</a></b> in mpeggy format!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/> <br/>I haven't been this impressed by the marvels of science since I first saw  Man Walk on the Moon, or played <b><a href="http://www.etoys.co.uk/toy/g/product/180/07/46/">Kerplunk</a></b>!!!!!<br/> <br/><i>(Thanks to <b><a href="http://www.ntk.net/">NTK</a></b> for alerting us to this site!!!!!)</i>
