Honestly!!!!! You wonder why all those wacky religious types in the US keep missing the flipping point!!!!! There all this business of them trying to question the teaching of evolution, (As opposed to the entirely scientifically credible scenario of a supernatural entity going <i>"Hey Presto!!!!"</i>, and, blammo, there's the universe, or something like that!!!!!!!) when evolution might in fact be dead!!!!!!! <br/><br/>At least, for humans anyway!!!!!! In this <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/features/features.jsp?id=ns227341">spiffy article</a>, it's argued that physically humans have hardly evolved from 50,000 years ago!!!!!!!!! Mind you, it also mentions that some people argue that in terms of brainpower and culture, we're actually evolving at Warp 9!!!!!!!!!!! (Hmmm... That's sounds a <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_09_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#832864">little familiar</a>, doesn't it?!??!?!)<br/><br/>No doubt in future, when we'll all be communicating in "XML" through our "PDAs" about the latest data "packets", some idiots will be going around trying to ban the Sinclair ZX81 because it's "un-Godly"!!!!!! But, hey, that's evolution for you!!!!!!!
