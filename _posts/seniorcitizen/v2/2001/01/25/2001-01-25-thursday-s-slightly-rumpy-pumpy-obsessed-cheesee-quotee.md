Two's company. Three's the result. [Eh?!?!? Wot if it's two inanimate objects!??!?!? Unless they have Trekky type "replicator" technologoy, I see this scenario as somehow a little unlikely!!!!!! Oh, wait a sec, you're talking about two folks... erm, OK, then!!!!! No, wait, hang on a mo!!!! Wot about if it's two blokes?!?!?!? Or an impotent bloke?!?!??!? Or a sterile woman?!?!??!?! You haven't exactly thought this one out, have you, sonny boy!!!!!!!!]
