Compared to the sorry state of the above gramophones, my purchase of <b>Dire Straits</b>' platter "Brothers In Arms" begins to look a little more palatable!!!!! So it's a jolly odd coincidence to read the <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/25-1-19101-23-21-45.html">following story</a> today... Apparently archaeologists have found out what we all knew for ages: Mark Knopfler, the headband wearing frontman of Dire Straits, is a dinosaur!!!!!! To be exact he's called <b>masiakasaurus knopfleri</b>, and is "about 6ft long with peculiar teeth and jaws"!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Yes, you guessed it!!!! Some archaelogists found a new dinosaur whilst playing a lot of Dire Straits on their CD-o-gram, and thought it would be a bit of a laff to name it after the venerable widdly guitar maestro!!!!!!<br/><br/>Wow!!!! Wot bunch of wacky cards they must be in Archaeology-land!!!!!!!!
