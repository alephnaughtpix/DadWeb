Apparently some beer called <b>Skullsplitter</b> has <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/ferguson/archive/25-1-19101-21-31-17.html">won some sort of award</a>!!!!!!!! Wot's more, the name comes from a number of similarly bizzarely named Vikings who in tha olden days maurauded the Orkneys where this beer is made!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">Nowadays, our names tell people nothing. Tony Blair. William Hague. Not like Magnus Bare-legs, Einar Belly-Shaker, Arni-Pinleg, Botof the Stubborn, Halfdan Longleg, Olaf Tit-bit, Sigurd the Fake-Deacon, and all the other crazed characters who limp or slaughter their way through the Orkney sagas.</div><br/><br/>After this award, I can't wait for the flood of similarly Viking inspired beer names!!!!!! "Bellyshaker" sounds like a good one already!!!!!! Mind you, I dunno if a beer called "Fake Deacon" would be that successful!!!!!!!
