OK, there's not actually not much to write about today, so here's a rant about the worst ever records wot I have purchased- like, with my own money!!!!!<br/><ul><li>"The Enraged Will Inherit The Earth" by <b>McCarthy</b>!!!!!! My second flipping indie purchase, and it was just so dire!!!! The worst late 80s indie musical cliches one can imagine, (jangly guitars, cheap organs, jumpy drums, crap cello+violin on the "thoughtful" songs!!!!) plus hilariously badly written right-on Socialist Worker style cliches!!!!<p><li>"Manhattan Shuffle" by <b>Landscape</b>!!!! <i>"Wot, like the 'Einstien a Go Go' people?!??!?"</i> I hear you peeps roar!!!!!! Erm, I'm not entirely sure!!!! If they were, they had by this album somehow mutated into some horrible "poppy" early 80s proto-"boy band" with 80s squiggly keyboard sounds, out-of-tune vocals, sub-pub band "tunes", and a "recorded in me shed in a couple of hours!!!!" style production!!!!!<p><li><b>Some dreadful "progressive" house record I've never actually bothered to listen to all the way through, and whose name I have (purposefully) forgotten</b>!!!!!! I must admit, I was fooled by this one when I saw this lying in a pile of bargain bin singles in a charity shop!!!! I think it was the "elevate your mind" and "higher plane" type title on the front that led me to think this might be some lost rave anthem!!!! I put it on and was assailed by the type of rubbish that in 1993 made "cheesy hardcore" seem an infinitely better proposition!!!! You know the drill- some inept "progressive" attempt to recapture the glory days of Chicago deep house: loads of piano stabs, terribly weedy string synths (usually doing some sort of high-note "hit" on the bar at the chorus, in the style of Soul II Souls' "Back to Life") and about 3 backing singers attempting a "gospel" style "choir"!!!<p>Then the verse begins and the most insipid and melismatic voice ever starts intoning: <i>"Mmmmm..Ahahahaarrggh... Peee-pulllll!!!!! Weee Gotta It Togeh-tha!!! Becaauusse the worrrllld..."</i> (etc. Go on about how bad the world is for the entire flipping verse!!! Now it's time for the chorus...) <i>"Sooo wee gotta get it togethaa-aa-aah!!!! Move yo-ourrr miinnd to a hhiiiggghhheer plaaa-haaiinnn-nn!!!!!!"</i> At which point, I ripped the needle off the record, and put the single back in my collection, right at the top, as a permanent reminder to not be such a plank next time!!!!! (Still, I got <b>U96</b>'s ace sicko Belgian hardcore tune "I Wanna Be A Kennedy!" at the same time, so it wasn't all bad!!!!)</p></li></p></li></p></li></ul>
