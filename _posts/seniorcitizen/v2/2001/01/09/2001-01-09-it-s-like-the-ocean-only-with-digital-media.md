U-no, when all this handheld computing malarkey starts taking off, you're going to have a new problem to content with- where do you stick all your data!??!?!?! You can't exactly go walking around with about 20 squillion Zip disks in your pockets, can you?!??!?! If everybody did that, and had loads of magnetic media on their person, compasses would stop pointing north and aeroplanes would arrive in the wrong place!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So how to solve this pressing problem!?!?!? Well, one way would be to toddle along to the Western Isles and jump off a cliff into tha Big Briney!!!!!!! (By which I of course mean the Atlantic Ocean, not the innards of a rotund bloke called Brian!!!!!)<br/><br/>Seems unlikely?!??!?! Well, you'd be wrong!!!!!!!!! In fact, the boffins at DARPA, the original brains behind tha NetWeb, are working on a Freenet/Gnutella/PloppyTrader stylee data storage network called <b><a href="http://www.forbes.com/futuretech/forbes/2001/0108/242.html">OceanStore</a></b>!!!!!!!!!! Only prob- won't the data get a little soggy?!??!?!?
