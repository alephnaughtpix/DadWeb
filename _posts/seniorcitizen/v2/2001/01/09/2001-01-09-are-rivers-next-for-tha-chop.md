Hello people!!!! Have any of you folk been on tha NetWeb 2day??!?! Well, obviously, you're on it now!!!!!! Trying to get hold of <b>Senior Citizen</b> without being on tha NetWeb is a bit difficult!!!!!! Unless you've rreceived an offline copy of this page from a friend- in which case, you can get your friend to read this story instead!!!! <br/><br/>Woops, where was I!??!?!? Anyway!!!! You folks on tha w3!!!!!! Have you been listening to any streaming audio/vid stuffs!??!?!?! Well, isn't it annoying how crap they are!?!??!?! They usually look like they've been recorded on a Super 8 in 1968, transferred to a home videogram in 1974, digitised on a Acorn Electron in 1985, and then encoded into MPEG format using a 286 PC in 1994!!!!!! And that's before we get to the "transferred over a 1432 baud connection by a server running on a Sinclair Spectrum" type speeds!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So wot can we do?!?!?! Well, you could help solve the problem by streaming some stuff by Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain!!!! That's because they're both dead!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Yes, that's right, some bod is proposing the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/528">"death" of streaming</a>!!!!!!!!!!
