Looks like old friend <b>Lego</b> is undergoing a bit a rennaisance at the mo!!!!!!!! First they added robotics, now they're adding <b><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m0YBL/34_23/66453978/print.jhtml">Steven Speilberg</a></b>!!!!!!!! Yes, the director of <b>Jurassic Park 2</b> and other classic movies has lent his name to a new Lego set which includes a digicam and PC software, which allows afficionadios of tha mighty brick to make their own Lego Movies!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>And movies are starting to appear on tha NetWeb now!!!!!!!! Already we've got <a href="http://surrealist.custard.org/lego/dead/">Lego Video Nasties</a> and <a href="http://drew.corrupt.net/lp/">Lego Porno</a>!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>No doubt, we'll be having Lego Reality Docu-soaps next!!!!!!! At least they'll be more interesting than the real thing!!!!!!!!!
