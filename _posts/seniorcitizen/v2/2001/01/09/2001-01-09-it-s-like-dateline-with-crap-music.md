Well, as you might know, it's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1107000/1107959.stm">Lunar Eclipse Night</a> here on Bonney Scotland!!!!!!!! So for all you 98% of readers from outside the UK, you'll have to find something else to do!!!!!! Especially if you're a sad indie spod!!!!!!!! Well, help is on the way, thanks to a spiffy w3site called The <a href="http://www.makeoutclub.com/"><b>Make Out Club</b></a>- a "courting" service for... sad indie spods!!!!!! Which is amusing given the popularity, amongst such souls, of a beat combo called <b>Limp Bizkit</b>!!!!!! Mind you, it could be worse!!!! It could be a UK band called "Half Mast"!!!!!!!
