U-no, I saw some crap boy band on tha tellybox the other night!!!!! But what I didn't know what that I was watching the future of computing!!!!!! (Which was jolly ironic, as I was thinking at the time that I was actually watching the future of robotics!!!!!!!!!!) Yep, fresh faced youngsters like A1 might have something in common with the computes of tomorrow- they depend on "armies of very small fans"!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Of course there will be a difference!!!! According to <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns9999330">this     article</a>, the fans in the computes will be 8 millimetres across, use "scratch     drives", and will cool microchips!!!!!!! And they'll be a bit more intelligent     presumably.
