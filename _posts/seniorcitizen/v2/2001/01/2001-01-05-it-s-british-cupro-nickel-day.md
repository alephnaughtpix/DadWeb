Apparently in 1947, the UK Royal Mint started replacing silver coins with coins made of "cupro-nickel"!!!!!!! Crickey, that sounds like something they make rocket ships from in <b>Dan Dare</b>, doesn't it?!?!??!?! "It's alright Professor Gubbins, the ship's hull is made of strengthened cupro-nickel!!!!!!!!! If it's strong enough for your 50 Imperial Shillings pieces, then we're safe as houses from those bally meteors!!!!!!!"
