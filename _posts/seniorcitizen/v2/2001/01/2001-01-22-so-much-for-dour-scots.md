Well, I never!!!!!!! Apparently us Scots are not a bunch of humourless cretins after all!!! According to some survey, we were the <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/22-1-19101-0-1-26.html">the happiest folks in the UK</a> last year!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Next they'll be finding out we don't all wear kilts all the time or venture out of our "crofts" to go running around the "glens" and "lochs" shooting "haggis"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
