Well, here's one way to improve the quality of one's "ecological footprint"!!!!!     Apparently there's this thingy called "<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns9999325">sustainable     farming</a>", which is becoming all the rage (And no doubt really cheesing     off those Monsanto type peeps) by ditching all the big business end of farming,     including ploughs!!!!!! Apparently, the amount of farmland using this technique     is <i>"an area the size of Italy"</i>!!!!!! (Though no mention is     made of whether this inlcudes the Vatican City or not!!!!!!!!) And wot's more     impressive is that it's so popular because it works jolly well and sends farm     yields "soaring"!!!!!!! Erm, wouldn't one need a rocket or something     for that!??!?!??!
