Apparently the world market might be going into a bit of a downturn!!!!!!!!! But if it does, don't worry!!!!! You'll be able to turn on the radio and not suffer S Club 7 or such simmilar dross again!!!!! That's because   according to this bloke, a recession is <a href="http://www.q4music.com/features/DisplayFeature.cfm?ObjectUUID=35141D22-E55E-11D4-9CDC000629DEBDC3">good   for pop music</a>!!!!!!!! Except that of course a lot of people won't be able   to afford these brillibobs pop records!!!!
