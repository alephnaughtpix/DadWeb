Talking of boy band fans, here's a new concept for you: <b><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/dailynews/news.jsp?id=ns9999329">Dense Matter</a></b>!!!!!!!! Yes, this matter is not-too-bright and a bit slow moving!!!!!! And it might be the type of matter that existed a few "millionths" of a second into the existance of tha Universe, then disappeared!!!!! Presumably by the end of that time it had went to school or something!!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, it's said to still exist in neutron stars, which are reknowned for being spectacularly "thick" and "dim"!!!!!!!!!
