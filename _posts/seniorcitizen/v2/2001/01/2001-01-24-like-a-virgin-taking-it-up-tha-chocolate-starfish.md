Crikey!!!! According to this <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/01/08/virginity_pledge/print.html">"analysis" article thingy</a>, there are a lot of strange messed-up young folk in tha US regarding attitudes to rumpy-pumpy!!!!!!! Apparently some blokes think that the virginity of a ladyfriend can be preserved despite rumpy-pumpy, as long as Tommy Todger takes a drive up Chocolate Lane!!!!!! Similarly some young womenfolk think that playing the Lollipop Game isn't exactly having it off either!!!!!!! There's even some more mature folk, whom one would think would know a little better, who further muddy the waters with the concept of a "technical virgin"!!!!!! (Wot, like someone who's new to the wonderful world of computing or suchlike?!??!?! Look you silly dolts!!!!! You've either had it "off" or not!!!!!!! "Technical Virgins"!??!?!?! It's a bit like calling you lot "technical buffoons"!!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>No flipping wonder Bill Clinton said he didn't have "sexual relations" with that Monica Lewinsky!!!! According to the logic displayed above, her playing his One String Bass wasn't exactly doing "it", was it?!?!??!?!
