Crikey!!!! Even Rod Stewart's starting to admit to <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/8-1-19101-1-40-19.html">feeling a bit old</a> now!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">"I'm still very presentable but I just can't keep up with Mick," he said, referring to Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman. "He has an unbelievably small backside and that's what women go for," he said.</div><br/><br/>Mysteriously enough, he's promoting a new album called "Human", which presumably expands on this "I'm just an ordinary bloke now" type stuffs!!!!!!! Mind you, it could be worse!!!!! He could have titled it "Rod Stewart And His Unfeasibly Large Backside"!!!!!!!!!!
