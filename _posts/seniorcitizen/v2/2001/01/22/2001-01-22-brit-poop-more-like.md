Thanks to those jolly nice peeps at "<a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~tewing/singlesb.html">New York, London, Paris, Munich</a>", I have been alerted to this one!!!!! Some music w3zine called "<a href="http://www.dancingaboutarc.com/"><b>Dancing About Architecture</b></a>" (As in the famous statement that to the effect that writing about about music is akin to dancing about architecture, which makes one wonder why these folks named their music writing zine thusly!!!!!!! I mean, one might as well call it "<b>Completely pointless!!!!!!</b>" or "<b>We're Crap!!!!!!!!!!</b>"!!!!!! Er, where was I again?!?!??!?! Oh yes!!!!!)<br/><br/>These folks at the bizzarely named NetWebPub (!!!!!!!) have come up with a rather amusing "British" themed zine!!!!! Actually, it's a nice idea, given the current US dominance of UK pop media (ie if a band get 10 number 1s in the UK, but only one top 10 in US, don't expect them to get a nice write-up in VH1's "Behind The Music"!!!!!) but look at the flippin' CD revoo section, which includes such hot tips as <b>Coldplay</b> and <b>The Beautiful South</b>!!!!!!!!!! I mean, haven't these folks even heard of <b>Gilbert O'Sullivan</b>!??!?!??!!
