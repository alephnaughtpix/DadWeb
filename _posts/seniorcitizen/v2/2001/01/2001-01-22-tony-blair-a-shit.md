And continuing the "feacal" f(th)eme (!!!!) .... Blimey!!!!!!! The <b>Glasgow Herald</b> is getting even more "liberal" in it's use of "direct" language!!!!!! We've already had the "<a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/?/2000_09_17_seniorcitizen_archive.html#874654">Bullshit Buzzer</a>", now they've dropped the "bull"!!!!!!!! And had it applied to no less a personage than <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/opinion/reid/archive/22-1-19101-22-2-35.html">tha PM</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">He told them he thought Blair was a shit, a comment I would find difficult to challenge on the grounds of objective accuracy, but parliamentary language it isn't.</div><br/><br/>One would thought that young chap <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2000_12_10_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1672542">William Hague</a> would have picked up on that one!!!!!!! After all, he's used nearly every other possible crap insult!!!!!!!!!!!!
