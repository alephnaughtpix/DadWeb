The cruellest lies are often told in silence. [Wot?!??! Like, using telepathy or something?!?!??! Sounds like a bit of a problem area to me!!!! After all, if one's telling fibs with the power of ones mind, then all the other person has to do is read the other parts of ones mind in order to ascertain the veracity of these extra-sensory whoppers!!!!!!!!!!]
