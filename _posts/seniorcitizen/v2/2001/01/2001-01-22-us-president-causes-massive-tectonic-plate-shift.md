This might be the last <b>Senior Citizen</b> ever!!!!!! Because I might be drowned tonight!!!!!! Why?!?!?! Well, I'm expecting a rather massive tidal wave to be sweeping around the world, eventually reaching our shores and submerging everything in sight!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Hmmmmm!!!!! So you wonder what would cause such a calamitous event?!?!! Well, it appears the United States of America has shifted massively West-ward!!!!!!! In an otherwise run-of-the-mill <a href="http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4120685,00.html">article</a> about George "Dubya" (Some nice young man told me that "Dubya" was <i>"Texan for 'reformed cokehead' "</i>- but I could be wrong!!!!!!! And, while we're on the subject, what exactly is wrong with drinking Coca-Cola anyway?!?!?) Bush, there is contained within a sentence of extraordinary ramifications for humankind!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">The day Bush was sworn in, the Atlantic doubled in width.</div><br/><br/>Errr... This tidal wave does seem to be taking it's time tho!!!!!! Still- enough time to finish of a couple more stories!!!!!! Great, huh!!!!!!!
