Dunno about you, but I personally cannot wait to get this week over with!!!!! Next week, Channel 4's early morning stalwart, the <b><a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/big_breakfast/">Big Breakfast</a></b> is getting relaunched after presenters Johnny Vaughn and Denise Van-Outen said their farewells last week!!!!!! In the interim period, most of the house is getting done up in preparation for the relaunch, and cramped into the spare spaces in the house are a procession of guest presenters on the show, and... Arrrggghh!!!! The weakest link in the BB chain- <b>Richard Bacon</b>!!!!!<br/><br/>Honestly!!!! I don't think I've seen a show plummet so fast!!!!!!! Even the new weather presenter, plucked at random from a crowd of hopefuls in rehearsals is better than this buffoon!!!!! Imagine a cross between Jeremy Paxman (without the intellect!!!) and Terry Christian (without the vaguely amusing fluffs and bumbling bits!!!!!) and then imagine this creature being as rude and patronising to everyone as possible!!!!! I've lost count of the amount of times he's told people to "shut up" in a vaguely "ironic" way!!! Even when he attempts to tell "jokes", it's completely ruined by a delivery and look that screams out:<i> "I'm being really funny here, you know!!!!!! So would you shut up and pay attention!!!!!!!!!"</i> And the way he orders people about: <i>"Right, now go over there!!!!! No, over there!!!!! Now, stop!!!!! Right, now shut up, I'm talking!!!!!!!"</i> He might as well grow a toothbrush moustache!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>And he's one of the five new presenters starting next week!!!!!!! So, sort yourself out, Richard!!!!! Or you soon might not have a Big Breakfast crew to order about!!!!!!
