Well, OK, this isn't really too much of "Tommorow's World" type thing- I mean you can already order videos on tha w3 already!!!!!!! But one of the first "proper" mmovie studios is now trying to do it with a "rental" system whereby one downloads a film onto one's compute!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So it's like those wacky pirate folk who trade "hooky" movies over tha w3!!!!! Except:<br/><ul><li>It costs money!!!!!<li>You can only play it for 24 hours before it deletes itself!!!!!!<li>The films are usually about half an hour long!!!!!!</li></li></li></ul>In fact, the only similarities are that you spend a long time on tha NetWeb and need wads of megabytes of HD space!!!!!! So I was basically talking crap, really!!!!!!<br/><br/>Anyway, it sounds like this wheeze will do really well, doesn't it?!?!??!?!?!? As long the licensing agreement don't ban you from <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_01_07_seniorcitizen_archive.html#1894007">speaking aloud</a> about the movie to your friends- if you have any!!!!!!!!!
