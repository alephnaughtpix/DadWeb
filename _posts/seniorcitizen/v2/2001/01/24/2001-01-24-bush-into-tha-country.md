There seem to an awful lot of "analysis" pieces about the newly appointed El Prez de la US these days!!!!!!!! Consequently there's a bit of competition to see who can come up with the most original observation!!!!!!! So you start seeing levels of wackiness like the one reached in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/argument/Regular_columnists/Terence_Blacker/blacker230101.shtml">this article</a>!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">The new suit'n'booted President and Nashville are a perfect match. In fact, some of Little George's best-known words and thoughts from the electoral campaign could easily be put to sweeping, pedal-steel accompaniment and turned into country songs: "Don't Misunderestimate Me", "America is Where Our Wings Take Dream" and - surely a country classic in the making - "If You Don't Stand For Anything, You Don't Stand For Anything".</div><br/><br/>!!!!!!!!
