U-no, the other day, I went down the old Oxfam shop, and picked up a copy of <b><a href="http://www.rowanatkinson.org/ntnon.htm">Not The Nine O'Clock News</a></b>'s spiffy comedy album "Hedgehog Sandwich"!!!!!!!!!! And it made me think: <i>"Why are there no resources on the NetWeb regarding our spiky nocturnal friends??!??"</i> (By which I of course mean hedgehogs, not those young whippersnapper "<a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/archives/2001_01_21_seniorcitizen_archive.html#2074442">neds</a>" who hang around the bustop between 7pm and 2am, and whinily brag on in their distinctive nasal twang about how much they were out of their "box" on various substances "the other night" at "Shug's place"!!!!!!!!! Woops, where was I?!?!?!?)<br/><br/>Anyway- I was wrong!!!!! There <i>are</i> hedgehog resources on tha w3!!!!!!! Check out this <a href="http://www.hedgehoghollow.com/faq/"><b>Usenet Hedgehog FAQ</b></a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It features such diverse subjects as "Hedgehogs as pets" and "Advanced Topics in Hedgehoggery"!!!!! (Which, actually, when I think on it, sounds a little rude!!!!!!) <br/><br/>In short, you could call it "Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Hedgehogs But Were Afraid To Ask In case You Felt A Bit Of A Prick!!!!!!!" (Doh!!!!!!!!!)
