Well, as our UK readers (all 23 of them!!!!!) know, shouty metal beat combo <b>Limp Bizkit</b> are currently nestling at the top spot in our <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/inside_r1/live_charts.shtml">Popular Music charts</a> with their latest gramophone <i>"Rollin'"</i>!!!!!!!!! And already there's a number of young fans writing into TV letters pages about the event!!!!!! And they're mostly not very complimentary!!!!!! In fact, they tend to go along the lines of:<br/><br/><div class="usenet">Limp Bizkit have sold out!!!! Their records are now bought by trendy people!!!! Their No. 1 hit proves how they have they turned into a shallow commercialised manufactured pap group catering to mindless robotic vegetable teenybopper sheep who just buy records to fit in rather than listen to real music played with real instruments, and with really meaningful lyrics!!!!! Enjoy your sucess, Judas Durst!!!!! I'll be listening to my "New Acoustic Movement" compilations from now on!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Signed,<br/>  Insane Voice of Meaningfullness</div><br/><br/>And no, I am not exaggerating!!!!! Well, OK, only a little!!!!! Still, it's most amusing to see people whining about tha Biz "selling out" when at around the same time last year the same band were doing the flipping movie theme tune to Mission Impossible 2!!!!! (<i>And</i> it was a jokey novelty re-working of the really rather ace original MI theme tune!!!!!!!) And it's also interesting to see Limp Bizkit, of all bands, inspiring a generation gap of "new/old" fan emnity that seriously rivals the Manics Street Preachers "old/new" fan battles!!!!!!!!
