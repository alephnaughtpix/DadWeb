Why haven't I heard of this brillibobs site before?!??!?!? It looks like I'm not the only one that's amazed at the (admittedly waning) popularity of Scotlands most popular newpaper, the <a href="http://www.record-mail.co.uk"><b>Daily Record</b></a>!!!!!! The bloody thing's like an embodiment of the Scottish Cringe in crap tabloid form!!!!!!!!! I certainly would not waste 30p on it, so I'm amazed that slightly less than half a million (and counting...) Scots would do as well!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Ahem, anyway!!!! Someone has been whiling away his time doing a jolly good Scottish satire mag- cunningly disguised as a (horribly accurate) parody of the Daily Record!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><div class="quote">In the continuing effort to make the First Minister smile, Henry Mcleish was asked yesterday why the chicken crossed the road. <br/><br/>Big Hen insisted that the chicken had in fact hit the ground running and contingency plans were being drawn up in order for it to make a robust contribution to the prosperity of the nation.</div><br/><br/>See?!?! So, check out the <a href="http://tommymackay.tripod.com/home.htm"><b>Daily Reckless</b></a>. Defiantely a better bet than <a href="http://www.seniordads.fsnet.co.uk/seniordads/features/citizen/v1/extras/str.html"><b>Scotland The Raw</b></a> anyway!!!!!
