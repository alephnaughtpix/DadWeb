I bet when you get crap text messages on your mobile telephone like <code>"Hlo will B l8 CU l8r!"</code> type stuffs, you never think: <i>"Hmmmm, I wonder if this message has the potential to topple a ruthless dictator halfway around the world?!?!?"</i>!!!!!!!!!! Well, to be honest, I have!!!!!!! But unfortunately I don't know the mobile phone numbers of any ruthless dictators!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Anyway- here's some enterprising young folk have done <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/World/Pacific_Rim/2001-01/text230101.shtml">just that</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>It does beg a question tho- if the old revolutionary Soviet flag was a hammer and sickle, will in future we have similarly revolution-themed flags depicting a mobile phone and a tommy gun!!?!??!?!?
