Well, if you want to really extend your pursuit of ecological conciousness,     then you can apply it to the pursuit of diminishing ones conciousness- at     tha pub, that is!!!! Yes, you can now get loadsa "real ale" type     drinks at watering holes now- and even at pubs!!!!!!! And you don't even have     to wear a wooly jumper or don a fake bushy beard to drink them now!!!!<br/><br/>So, it's about time a wacky w3site like <b><a href="http://www.bohemia.com/">The     Real Beer Page</a></b> has appeared isn't it?!?!?! And I see one <b>Michael     Jackson </b>is doing reviews for it!!!!!! No wonder he's taking so long to     finish that album of his!!!!! He must be getting drunk all the time on industrial     strength Real Ale!!!!!! Mind you, I dunno if that picture him is the right     one!!!!!! Unless of course, he's had plastic surgery.
