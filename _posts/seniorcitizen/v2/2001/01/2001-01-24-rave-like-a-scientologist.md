This is a bit strange!!!!! Apparently some group connected to the Church of Scientology have gone and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16273.html">ripped off wads of content</a> from some ravey w3site!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Dunno why tho!!!!! Mind you, Scientologists use that "E-Meter" thing, so they possibly could have got a bit confused with ravey culture at some juncture!!!!!! In which case, I woudln't be surprised if John Travolta's working on "Battlefield Earth II", in which Johnny MulletBoy saves the Earth yet again from nasty aliens- by getting a whole load of people into a field and playing loads of "tuff" UK Garage on a "kickin'" sound system!!!!!!!!!!
