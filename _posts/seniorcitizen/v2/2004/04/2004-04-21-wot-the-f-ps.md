Flippin' eck!!!!! Probably says a lot that I went to Dublin for a jolly, and then I wake up and find myself in Barcelona!!!!!!! In Spain!!!!! In Europe!!!!!! In planet Earth!!!!! In tha solar system!!!!!! In the Milky way (OK, I'll stop now!!!!)!!!!! It was a bit easy to mistake the two places, because apart from the completely different geography, massively bigger size, the slightly sunnier weather, and the fact that tha locals speak in two completely different lingos to English, the two cities are completely similar!!!!! And by "lingo" I of course mean words wot you speak, not antipodean feral canines!!!!! (And I'm not just talking about their teeth either!!!!!!!)<p>Anyway, I'm back!!!!!!! Although I will be making an appearance in Spain again next week!!!!! And I might even write about it this time!!!!!!!<p>By the way, you may have noticed that Blogger now allows posts to have titles!!!!! Well, you may not have noticed, but I certainly have!!!!! And now, you can get all these super-duper posts on tha state of tha w3 on your <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=697" title="It sez here...">newsie-reader</a> thanks to a new <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/atom.xml" title="In XML!!!!!">RSS feed</a> on this site!!!!!! Amazing or wot?!?!?!? Wot?!?!?!?!?</p></p>
