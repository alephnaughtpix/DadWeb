No doubt, it'll bring out all the usual types wanting to defend Britain from a EU "monolith" which presumably wants to force hideous continental concepts like integrated public transport systems on Britain!!!!!<p>Well, the EU might be big at the mo, but on the 1st May, it'll get even bigger, when 10 former Eastern Bloc (You can tell they're Eastern, becuase they spell "block" funny!!!!) nations join!!!!! Among them is Lithunia, who have now got this "label" to describe their economy!!!! You know the type- smaller countries that do well with their ecomonies get called things like "the Celtic tiger", "the Nordic leopard", "the Latin hamster", "the Balkan Platypus", etc., etc., Well, apparently Lithuania is the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,7369,1195905,00.html" title="'Its neighbours have hared ahead with economic reforms'- DOH!!!!!!!!!">Baltic Tortoise</a>!!!!!!!!<p>Wot, like they all eat lettuce and go to sleep for 6 months up there!?!??!</p></p>
