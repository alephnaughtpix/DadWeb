Peeps who say I'm often a bit "down" on Americans are of course complete and utter cretins!!!!! I'm the first to recognise the <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_seniorcitizen_archive.html#110070062091790966">amazing achievements</a> of Yankie Boffinz!!!!! And here's an American story to warm the heart of your cockles!!!!!!! A bunch of folks have completed a journey across America... on <b><a href="http://www.10mph.com/">Segway transporters</a></b>!!!!!! Obviously going at the pace of a snail was designed to give the intrepid explorers a "true picture of America" or something!!!!!!! (As opposed to merely zapping across the continent on a <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_seniorcitizen_archive.html#110070062091790966">Scramjet</a>!!!!!)<br/> <br/>Anyway, they've ended up Boston, of Tea Party fame!!!! (Which, when you think of it, is a jolly funny name, as they didn't actually <i>drink</i> any tea!!!!! Maybe they should have called it The "Boston Throwing The Tea Into The Sea Party", but that would be hard to fit on an invite card!!!!!!!!! But I digress!!!!!!) Anyway, as the they say on the site <i>"... in the midst of all of this comes a lone Segway rider -- Josh Caldwell -- who will become another legendary figure in the history of the greatest city in the greatest country. Move over pilgrims..."</i> <br/> <br/>No doubt there will be erected in Boston, a 10ft statue in gold of a man on a unicyclical electrically power vehicle, riding into history!!!!!!! Then, when you're an old man, you can travel to Boston (Assuming it hasn't <a href="http://seniorcitizen.blogspot.com/2001_08_01_seniorcitizen_archive.html#5365781">fallen into the sea</a>!!!!!!!!) and tell all the young whippersnappers that you remember when you read about this on Senior Citizen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
