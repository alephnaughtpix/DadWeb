This is interesting!!!!!! Seems some beat combo called <b>Wilco</b> got dropped by their record company because their thought their gramophone was bobbins!!!! Then said group streamed the disputed gramophone on da NetWeb, then when it was finally released by some other folks, it became a popular chart hit platter!!!!! <br/> <br/>Anyway, here's an <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,65688,00.html" title="Wonder if he wears a 'Tweedy' jacket?!?!?!?">interview thingy</a> with the wonderfully named <b>Jeff Tweedy</b> from said beat combo!!! Among the interesting observations in the interview include the lack of resemblence of popular music to "a loaf of bread" or a "a tennis shoe"!!!!<br/> <br/>Blimey!!!! If the music industry can't tell the difference between a CD and Hovis, then no wonder they're in trouble!!!!! Can you imagine trusting an entire industry to people who put CDs in toasters?!?!?!?!?
