Hello folks!!!!!!! Have you ever wanted to go at the speed of over 9 times the speed of sound (Yes!!!!! 9 times the amount of 'elephants' it takes for the text from this screen to reach your eyeballs!!!!) in the upper atmosphere of Planet Earth on a tiny jet thingy for about 10 seconds before landing in tha briney!?!?!?!? Well, now this technology has <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/story.jsp?story=583728" title="'Rockets do not &quot;breathe&quot; air', apparently!!!!!">came to pass</a>!!!!!! <br/> <br/>It's all thanks to a NASA "scramjet" (So-called presumably because it retires at great speed!!!!!) They didn't actually put any peeps on it, because with all the G-Force they would become like Mr Stick-Man!!!!! (And by G-Force, I of course mean, gravity, not some wacky folks in capes who battle Zoltar!!!!!) Apparently it was launched in a rocket wot is called "Pegasus"!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Crikey!!!! I thought scientests were too scientifically minded to go in for all that astrology gubbins!!!!!!
