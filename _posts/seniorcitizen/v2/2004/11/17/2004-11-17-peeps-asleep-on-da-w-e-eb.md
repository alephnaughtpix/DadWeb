The great thingy about the megmighty HyperInpho BroadPipe NetWeb CyberBlog BBSpace thingy is the amount of new things one learns about foreign cultures!!!!!!!!!! For one, I didn't know that if I were in Tokyo at night, I'd have to step over as many peeps sleeping in da street as in London Town!!!!!<br/> <br/>However, these are not your usual tramps and layabouts!!!!!! In fact, they all dress in suits!!!!! That's because they work jolly hard during the day!!!! Yes, in fact, they're industrious Japanese office workers!!!!! So industrious, that they often take a quick involuntary "nap" on the way home to their "pad"!!!!!!!! And this <a href="http://masamania.com/archives/2004/09/japanese_busine.html">fabulous w3sitey</a> records the phenomenomenemononmeomn!!!!! And even funnier are the comments afterwards!!!!<br/> <br/><div class="quote">Now this is the best reason I have to go to Japan. Sure the women are fine, but people sleeping in the streets?!?! Rock on! I can't wait to sleep in the street, I do it here all the time. People think I'm nuts. And I am. </div> <br/>Mind you, they eventually degenerate into the usual bunch of Americans waving their genitalia around, and then being surprised when the rest of the planet decides to kick them in the goolies!!!!!
