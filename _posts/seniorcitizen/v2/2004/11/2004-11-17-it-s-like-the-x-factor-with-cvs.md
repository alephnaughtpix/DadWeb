What would you do if you're on tha dole, and want to make a CV that really stands out?!?!?!? Well, this Frenchie chappie has set the bar somewhat, (In much the same way that Englebert Humperdink set the bar on classic pop gramophones!!!!) by doing his CV as a <a href="http://213.186.36.10/~al/alstudio/cv/en.htm" title="We at SDHQ really like the animated loading bar at the start here!!!!!">jolly little musical flash animation</a>!!!!!! So now you can see a funny animation occompanied by someone who's not exactly Val Doonican singing in a funky French accent about how he started off coding in Visual Basic!!!!!!<br/> <br/>Maybe we should wheel a laptop with this onto the "audition" bit one of those "reality" talent shows in order to see Simon Cowell's face!!!!!! It would certainly be more interesting than watching flipping Darius try his luck again!!!!!!!
