Well, here's a couple of things I never expected to see in the 21st century!!!!!<br/> <br/><ol start="8" type="a"><li>Xmas lights in Cambridge!!!!!!!<li>Someone famous switching on the Xmas lights in Cambridge!!!!! (Apparently in previous years such personages included the mighty <a href="http://www.astrotheme.fr/en/portrait.php?clef=v2wZz687nYpb&amp;info=true" title="Safari?!?!?! So (insert strained pun here)!!!!!!!!">Christopher Biggins</a>!!!!!!!!!!)<li>A punk rock beat combo who were mainly famous a quarter of a century ago switching on the Xmas lights in Cambridge!!!!! <li>Various members of the clergy getting hot under the collar about a punk rock beat combo who were mainly famous a quarter of a century ago switching on the Xmas lights in Cambridge!!!!!</li></li></li></li></ol>But it's happened!!!!! Apparently some bloke from some church is a bit put out at <b><a href="http://www.officialdamned.com/" title="Jolly nice to see Captain Sensible's still around!!!">The Damned</a></b> flicking a switch because <i>"We should not give a major function over to a group that goes out of its way to deny what Christmas is about."</i>. Because as everybody knows, Christopher Biggins switching on a load of fancy lights signalling the onset of the busiest season in a major thoroughfare of concentrated free-market capitalism is exactly what the birth of the Baby Jesus was all about!!!!!<br/> <br/>Crikey!!!! Just as well I kept quiet about <b><a href="http://www.paviliontheatre.co.uk/showHTML/past/oct_16_03.htm" title="Bet you're gutted you missed that one, eh?!?!?!?">Sidney Devine</a></b> switching on the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/planning/award/0026.jpg" title="Gateway to the East South East turning to Junction 34 of the B4232478!!!!">Milton</a> Christmas <a href="http://www.turingstudio.com/resources/images/desktops/1024/Lightbulb.jpg" title="Everyone was amazed!!!!!">Lights</a>!!!!!! That funny woman from down the pub would have probably annoyed me for about 34 seconds!!!!!!
