Hay!!!! We've added all the existing issues of version 1 of our blog [Senior Citizen](../features/citizen/) to our [Features](../features/) section!!!<!--more-->

This was in the late 90s, when it was still partially a mailing list, and one came out every week!!!! And as such, the use of HTML and minor CSS is complete and utter rubish!!!!! If you look at the source code behind it, it's a mess of FONT and CENTER and BGCOLOR directives!!!!! It still works on modern browsers, but it'll probably blow browsers of the future to smithereens!!!!!

Except for [issue #25](../features/citizen/v1/25.html)!!!! As a little test, we've recreated it in modern HTML and CSS, and as a result, it's nearly half tha size of the other issues!!!!! Blimey!!!! So we'll be doing that for the rest of the issues next!!!
