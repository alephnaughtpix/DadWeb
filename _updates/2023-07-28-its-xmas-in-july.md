We've spent so much time fixing up **[Senior Citizen v1](../features/citizen/v1)** that we almost forgot we havn't finished the bloddy [Demos](../demos/) section yet, and that's the most important bit!!!!!!!!!! So we're making up for lost time now!!!!!

The first demo to be restored is an unusual one in that neither [myself](../crew/#Old_Fart) or [Doddering Git](../crew/#Doddering_Git) wrote the main code for this one!!!!! It was [Dame Vera Lynn](../crew/#Dame_Vera_Lynn) and [Jackson Pollock](../crew/#Jackson_Pollock)!!!!! Go to the new page for **[The "Anti Teckno" Teckno Demo](../demos/teckno.html)**, and let The Dame himself tell you (in his unique style!!!!) how this came to be!!!!!!

But that's not all!!!!! Ironey of ironies!!!!! It's High Summer, and so we're bringing you a Christmas demoe!!!!!!!!! That's right, it's probably our greatest Atari demo, (so far!!!!!!) **[The Xmas Card '97](..//demos/xmas97.html)** demo!!!!!!!!

Now that those demos are up, we've updated [The Dame's Music section](../music/) to include the tunes from both demos!!!
