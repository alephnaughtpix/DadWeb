Guess what!!!! We finised converting all the issues of version 1 of our blog [Senior Citizen](../features/citizen/)!!! No more FONT tags,<!--more--> bye-bye to CENTER, and bog off BGCOLOR!!!!! (And let's not say any word about the whole "using TR and TD to position elements" malarkey!!!!) On average each issue is 11K smaller than the original, and when you consider that original was designed to load fast on a dial-up modem internet connection, you can imagine how zippy the loading of pages is now!!!!!

But that's not all!!!!! We've improved the [Article archive](../features/citizen/v1/archive.html) section!!!!!!!!! How?!?!?! Well, before it didn't actually work!!!! And now it does!!!!!! So, that's an improvement!!!!

But!!!! Wait!!!! There's more!!!!! We've added a whole new page to select [individual issues](../features/citizen/v1/)!!!!!! We did this because originally in the "Previous Issues" sidebar menu it only listed, erm, previous issues!!! So if you were reading an older issue, you couldn't easily get to newer issues!!!! Now you can select the "More issues" link, and select an issue!!!!! Now why didn't we think of that at the time!!!!!! We must have been too busy with all the FONT tags and CENTERing!!!!! Either that or down tha pub!!!!!
