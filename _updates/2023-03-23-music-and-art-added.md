We've restored two sections of the w3sitey!!<!--more-->

* We've added The Dame's [Music](../music/) section!!! Not all the chunky chunes are on it yet, but we'll be adding to it at the same time as we're adding the related demoes pages to the [Demoes](../demos/) section!!!
* We've added Jackson Pollock's [GFX](../gfx/) section!!!! We've even put a little Lightboxy thingy for when you're viewing all the lovely images!!!
