We've started restoring the [Features](../features/) section, starting with a restoration of [NetBest](../features/netbest/), our celeberation of the best of tha NetWeb!!!<!--more-->

Unfortunately, it was the best of tha NetWeb when we last updated the page in 1997!!!! So none of the original links work!!!! However, [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) to the rescue!!!! We were surprised to find that nearly all the w3siteys we featured in 1997 were archived and viewable enough, so we rejigged our links to point there!!!!

Wonder if it was us putting a spotlight on these marvels of webiness in 1997 that made them more likely to be archived, therefore making them available in 2023 for us to put the spotlight on how we put the spotlight on them in 1997?!?!?!?

(If Steven Moffat wrote a story like that, people's heads would explode!!!!!!!!!!)
