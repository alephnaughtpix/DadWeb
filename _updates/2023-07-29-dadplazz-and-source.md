We've now added [DadPlaz!!!!](../demos/dadplazz.html) to the [Demos](../demos/) section!!!!! But that's not all!!!!! What's that new looking *"GIT!"* link next to the FTP mirrors!??!?!?

Nope!!!!! It's not a hotline to [Doddering Git](../crew/#Doddering_Git)!!!!!!!! It's the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/theseniordads/dadplazz)!!!!!!

Ever since we started to restore the old website, we've been finding some of our old source code for our Atari demoes and thot: *"Hay!!!! Wouldn't it be groovy if we clean up this source code for modern users, and put it up on GitHub, so that our works are exposed for all posterity!??!?!! Yes, hay, let's do that!!!"*

And so we now have a [GitHub page](https://github.com/theseniordads)!!! And we've already got the source code for 4 demos up on them!!! Two of them have been checked for compatibility with modern assemblers such as [Vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/) and [Vlink](http://www.compilers.de/vlink.html), so you can even compile them on your compute, and run them in an emulator like [Hatari](http://www.hatari.tuxfamily.org/) without having to use DevPac!!!!! Wev've even annotated the code, so you can learn from our coding genius!!!!!

We hope to add more source code as we find it- keep your eyes peeled for the "GIT!" icon in the demos pages!!!!!!
