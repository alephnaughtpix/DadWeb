1,fanfare,Senior Dads Fanfare,"At the start of every Dads demo- this was the version at the start of <a href=""../demos/atuck.html"">Anal Tuck</a>. It signifies the end of the crumbling empire attitudes of those opposed to <em>&quot;one nation under a techno groove&quot;,</em> know what I'm saying?",1,2019-06-18 11:02:22.485727,2019-06-18 11:02:22.485727,59
2,theme,Senior Dads Theme,"From <a href=""../images/demos/colonic.html"">Colonic Irrigation</a>. It samples bits of the fanfare and twists and turns it over a happy hardcore/jungle ragga stylee. Mad, like a raving nuttah, but that's the kind of guy I am, you catching my drift?",2,2019-06-18 11:02:22.496560,2019-06-18 11:02:22.496560,60

4,liam,"Liam Gallagher, Kiss My Derriere (The Burp Song)","Also from the <a href=""../demos/ladmds2.html"">L'Aube Du Matin Du Soir II (Remix)</a>, this time from the endtro. Made to piss off that thick Neanderthal troglodyte Manc bastardo Gallagher twat, who said that people would dance to farts if they stuck beats on top of them. Well, of course they would, most beats-fortified farts hit the spot better than your shit-for-brains Beatle rip-offs, you top prize wankaah! So I made this killer chune completely outta burps! Beat that, <strong>Oasisn't</strong>!!!",4,2019-06-18 11:02:22.515549,2019-06-18 11:02:22.515549,62
5,MoveYourAss,Move Your Ass To The Senior Dads,"The monsta rave theme toon from the megademo <a href=""../demos/airdirt.html"">Air Dirt</a>. A classic dance floor filla that piles on tha crazee manic beats until it explodes! Treat with care, I take <strong>no</strong> responsibility if you spontaneously combust whilst listening to this twisted firestarter of a chune!",5,2019-06-18 11:02:22.527551,2019-06-18 11:02:22.527551,63
6,XmasBalls,Kick Santa in the Balls,"From <a href=""../demos/xmas97.html"">Xmas Card 97</a>. It's Christmastime, and there's a need to be afraid... Cause the Dame VL is kickin' it again with the ill-est Xmas Medley ever, dropping like a Hiroshima for the earholes, know what I'm saying?",6,2019-06-18 11:02:22.539551,2019-06-18 11:02:22.539551,64
7,NeverMindThePistols,"Never Mind the Pistols, Here's the Bollocks","From the <a href=""../demos/teckno.html"">Anti-Teckno Teckno demo</a>. A pumping techno soundtrack (This is 1992, so it sounds a bit more laid-back now!!!) BTW This is the first techno module ever in ST chip musix!",7,2019-06-18 11:02:22.553550,2019-06-18 11:02:22.553550,65
8,PastIsAnUndiscoveredCountry,The Past Is An Undiscovered Country- I Am The Viking To Rape And Pillage It,"From <a href=""../demos/mono.html"">Mono-mental</a>. It was a serious challenge to do a piece of killer music in mono, but you can agree I more than met it. And you notice how since then, you've got all those guys like Jack White going back to mono? Yep, Dame VL- ahead of the curve as always.",8,2019-06-18 11:02:22.567549,2019-06-18 11:02:22.567549,66
9,RaseroTeam,Rasero Team Fuck Out,"Lost after 14 years, so rare even I forgot about it! This chune was added in our patch to Reject's demo. We did this tune in response to some guys in Poland called the RASERO TEAM, who thought they were being clever by doing a demo called 'Senior Fucks out'! You wot, mate?!? That demo was just shit, and the ""music"" didn't even get the bass frequencies right! Maybe you can't code to our level, guys, but at least you can get the chunes sorted! So that's what I did, just to show them who's boss. A cool jungle remix of a shite lamers tune, know what I'm sayin'?",9,2019-06-18 11:02:22.576548,2019-06-18 11:02:22.576548,67
