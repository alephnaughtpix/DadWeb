<p>Erm, actually, this story doesn't really have anything to do with Joan Jett,
    rock 'n' roll, or jukeboxes, really!!!!! But it *<b>does</b>* have something
    to do with MP3s!!!!! And it's a good headline as well!!!! So, yah boo sucks, and
    erm anyway!!!! It seems a "big" week for MP3s, I even saw them get a mention on
    Breakfast telly today!!!!!! Anyway, you know those people, slightly younger than
    me, that spend zillions on a really "sound" (Doh!!!) hi-fi system with loadsa
    sad things like gold-plated plugs for "proper connection" and a funny anti-static
    "zap gun" for gramophones!!??! Well, you can now have a really good laugh as they
    buy an MP3 Player "component" for their hi-fi system, as this lot have started
    making them!!!!!</p><p>What do you mean, "what's funny about that"?!?!?! Well, despite
    what the people on Breakfast Telly might say, MP3s, due to their "lossy"
    compression are not really "CD quality" at all, especially if they're made from
    a "grungy" old analogue recording, as I found out when I tried to MP3 my
    Napalm Death collection!!!!! So in future, you'll be able to take a Jesus &amp; Mary
    Chain MP3 along to your friend, and when it's played on the MP3 player, and comes
    out sounding like a wonky cassette recording, you can really cheese him or her
    off by saying: "Erm, that's not really very good sound quality, is it?!?!??!?!"!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/inside_sources/98.11/98.11.20.phtml#COMDEXUPDATECompaniesToBuildMPDeckPlayer">http://www.maximumpc.com/inside_sources/98.11/98.11.20.phtml<br/>
