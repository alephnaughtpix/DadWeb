<p>The still-improving 
    <b>Newstrolls</b> site (See <a href="15.html#443"> issue 15</a>...) 
    has gone through another re-design, and now has added a really interesting 
    feature- now you can add your own news story to the "User" section!!!!! 
    We might try this idea soon- if we have the time that is!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/fpage/usertrolls/usertrolls.cgi">http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/fpage/usertrolls/usertrolls.cgi</a></p><p>BTW We've seen the first proper banner ad appear on Newstrolls, after about a month of a
    fake ad banner, which said something like "Hi! I'm a fake ad banner!!!!" - and it's
    from Slashdot!!!! And we think's actually pretty smart too....</p><p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/images/innernerd.gif">http://www.slashdot.org/images/innernerd.gif</a></p>
