<p>This "Dex Drive" thingy apparently allows you to plug in the memory
    card of a N64 or Playstation and allows you to read and write from it
    on a PC, like it was a Zip drive!! Apparently console fans will be able
    to swap high scores and other things that "will revolutionize console
    gaming as we know it"!!!!</p>
