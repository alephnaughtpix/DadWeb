<p>OK, this is an old one, but I was reminded of it in this months Fortean
    Times... You've probably heard of that book "The Bible Code" by Michael
    Drosnin, where he says the Bible predicts this, that, and everything
    else inbetween!!! Now, some people think it's just chance that certain
    letters equally spaced between each other just happen to make well known
    names and stuff!!! In his defence Drosnin said <i>"When my critics find a
    message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby
    Dick, I'll believe them"</i>. This is a reference to the claim that the
    assassination of Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin was predicted in the Bible!!!
    Well, someone's taken him up on it!!!! And they've found loadsa
    people in Moby Dick, including Yitzhak Rabin, who were assassinated after
    the book was published!!!</p><p><a hef="http://www.negia.net/~skepticx/Moby-Dick-Code.htm">http://www.negia.net/~skepticx/Moby-Dick-Code.htm</a></p>
