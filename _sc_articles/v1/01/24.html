<p>It seems that the latest challenge in demos, after the craze earlier
    in the year for 128 byte demos (Check <a href="../../../demos/dadplazz.html">ours</a> out!!!) is system friendly
    demos!!! The Black Lotus have already done a Windows 95 demo
    and now some guys on our favourite platform have done an Atari GEM
    demo!! You'll need an 68030 Atari with 16bit graphics (eg a Faclon!!)
    to run it though!!! What's really interesting about this one is that
    the crew are working on a third party module format so that others
    can slot in their own demo modules!!!</p><p>See <a href="http://wombat.ludvika.se/gemdemo/">http://wombat.ludvika.se/gemdemo/<a></a></a></p>
