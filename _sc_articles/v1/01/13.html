<p>Awww, now this really warms the cockles of my heart!!! Motorola
    and the dudes that make the PalmPilot (3Com!!) have got together
    to offer "wireless messaging" for the little Palm Pilot computers!!
    You get this "Synapse pager card" thingy, and plug into your
    compute!! Well, it's a little easier than juggling between a
    palm computer and a mobile!!! So, how long before we get actual
    modem thingies?!?!? Who knows?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/98/114472.html">http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/98/114472.html</a></p>
