<p>Oh yeah, the French did reasonably well too here I gather... Anyway, if
    you were sick of the World Cup, you'll be even sicker if you use
    MS Word!!! "W97M/WorldCup98" is another variation of the world's
    most popular strain of virus, MS Word Basic Macro Viruses!! This
    one apparently will add a couple of lines to your autoexec.bat
    to format your HD on the day of the World Cup final!!! Even
    wackier, on the day, a dialog appears asking what team you
    support, and if you pick one the virus writers like, you get
    a congratulations message!!! (It still does the dirty though!!!)</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/06/worldcupvirus.idg/index.html">http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/06/worldcupvirus.idg/index.html</a></p>
