<p>Some French astronomers have found a planet roughly 3 times the size
    of Jupiter about 60 light years away form here!! It's called "Gliese 614",
    but I've decided it should really be called "Big Blob" because it's
    really big and like Jupiter it's a big blob of soft stuff!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.physci.psu.edu/~mamajek/exo.html#14Her">http://www.physci.psu.edu/~mamajek/exo.html#14Her</a></p>
