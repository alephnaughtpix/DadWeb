<p>Great!!! Our "<a href="../../..//demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a>" demo really gets a slagging in the lastest
    issue of Undercover, the Atari diskmag!!! It seems that Moondog has
    decided not to like our demos after all!!! Ah well, we couldn't get
    brilliant reviews all our lives!!! Actually, Moondog suddenly seems to
    be against all "fake" demos- why he's included us in it we don't know
    since we're art terrorist multimedia gurus, not a "fake demo" crew!!
    Mind you, the poor bloke seems to be negative these days about
    everything!!!!</p><p>Anyway, have a look at UCM12- it's at
    <a href="http://wombat.ludvika.se/ae/dhs_files/misc/ucm12.lzh">http://wombat.ludvika.se/ae/dhs_files/misc/ucm12.lzh</a>
    It's an Atari prog, but PC dads can run it under Pacifist!!! (we
    run it under v0.44) You'll probably need anti-depressant drugs after
    reading it tho!!</p><p>You can get Pacifist from
    <a href="http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/">http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/</a> . You can also run our "Monomental" demo in Pacifist (Put it in hi-res mode!!)!!! Get the demo from <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/demos/mono/mono.html">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/demos/mono/mono.html</a> and decide for yourself!!!!</p>
