<p>Someone's been really pissing off a lot of newsgroups, especially
    religious and conspiracy ones, by continally posting the Bible a chapter
    at a time!!!! The posting addrs keep changing, and are usually obvious
    made-uppies, tho sometimes he appears to be posting from xs4all.nl!!
    (ie the Netherlands in Europe!!) But last Saturday, it got interesting
    as the posting addr was
    <i>the_time_is_near@praise_God.no.domain.specified (nine days and counting)</i>
    So- at the time of writing, it's 2 days to go to... what?!?!? We'll
    find out on Monday I suppose!!! That's Monday 13th!!!! (The day after the
    World Cup Final- hmmm....) <i>(Actually, that's <b>today</b>!!!!)</i></p>
