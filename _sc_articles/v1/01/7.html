<p>And you thought Heaven's Gate were a wacky bunch of Yanks that killed
    themselves because of a comet in the sky!!! Nope!!! There's some
    Polish server with all the Heaven's Gate guff on it now, and someone
    (presumably the person behind the server!!) posted a message called
    "I'm from Heaven's Gate" on <a href="news://alt.conspiracy">news://alt.conspiracy</a> with just the URL for the
    website!!! So if you hear of some Polish cult killing themselves off,
    remember where you heard it first!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.byd.top.pl/~heaven/">http://www.byd.top.pl/~heaven/</a></p>
