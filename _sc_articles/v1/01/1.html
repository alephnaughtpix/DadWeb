<p>Imagine if a computer a game could see how difficult you're finding
    the game, and adjust itself!!! Well, the guys at MIT are working on
    it!!! According to the link below, "researchers at
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab are working on
    computers that can "read" a person's mind by monitoring body movements."
    Unfortunately, being the boring people that they are, they're
    using it for more serious stuff like "effective tutors" or video
    recorders that "sense your boredom and fast-forward through the dull
    parts of a movie", but I'm sure you can see the interesting
    applications!!! One prob tho- if Windows gets hold of that sort of
    technology, and reads people reactions to it, I can imagine it
    becoming really depressed, like a sort of Marvin the Paranoid Android
    of operating systems!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/05/caring.computer.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/05/caring.computer.ap/</a></p>
