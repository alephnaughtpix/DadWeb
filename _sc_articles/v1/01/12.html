<p>John Romero who use to be in ID software, and was involved in
    in Wolfenstien and Doom and blah de blah, and then left to
    form his own company called "ION Storm" (Wow!! Great name!!!),
    has done some new game thingy called "Daikatana". Don't ask me
    how to pronounce that though!!! In the link below, you can
    see a piccy of the thingy (Don't look like Wolfy/Doom/Quake at
    all!!!), and a piccy of some hairy Jeff Minter lookalike!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/169567.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/169567.asp</a></p>
