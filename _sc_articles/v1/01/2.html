<p>Who owns the smiley logo?!?!??! Apparently it's some Frenchie
    guy called Franklin Loufrani who did it in 1968 for publications
    about the Paris student riots and trademarked it in 1971, but the
    guy that actually designed first it was an American called Harvey
    Ball who first did it in 1963 for an insurance company
    promotion!!!! So it's a bit of a not-so-smiley business going on!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/07/fringe.smiley.face.off/">http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/07/fringe.smiley.face.off/</a></p>
