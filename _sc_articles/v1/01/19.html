<p>Apparently Real Player, that spiffy little audio/visual player thingy
    doesn't check certain things about the incoming stream, so you can
    write a proggy on a webserver to pretend to be a "real" stream, and
    completely lock up someone's Real Player app!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.rootshell.com/archive-j457nxiqi3gq59dv/199807/rpk.c.html">http://www.rootshell.com/archive-j457nxiqi3gq59dv/199807/rpk.c.html</a></p>
