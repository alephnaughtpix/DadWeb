Scientists this week decoded the first confirmed alien transmission from
outer space. Here is the text of the message that they decoded:

"THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!!

Just send 5*10*50 atoms of hydrogen to each of the five star systems
listed below. Then, add your own system to the top of the list, delete
the system at the bottom, and send out copies of this message to 100
other solar systems. If you follow these instructions, within 0.25 of
a galactic rotation you are guaranteed to receive enough hydrogen in
return to power your civilization until entropy reaches its maximum!"</pre>
