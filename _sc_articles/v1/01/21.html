<p>This is certainly giving us a few ideas for our "Killer Nut" section!!
    There are now a couple of "write your own adventure story" sites- you
    remember those "do your own thing" type books where you came to some
    conundrum at the end of one page and you've got to turn to page xx
    according to what decision you make and so on?!?!? Well, it's pretty
    easy to do on the web!!! And now they can be self writing!!! On the
    one below if you get to the end of a path, you can add your own bit and
    choices to it!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.snoot.com/cgi-bin/binary.cgi">http://www.snoot.com/cgi-bin/binary.cgi</a></p>
