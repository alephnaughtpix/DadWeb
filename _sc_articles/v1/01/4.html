<p>Nothing like taking things to extremes!!!! Some blokes weren't satisfied
    flaming with another guy on AOL chatrooms, so a few of them turned up
    at this guys house and set about him with baseball bats!!! Well, some
    of the "flames" I've seen on the internet could be summarised in the
    word "Ug!", so I'm not too surprised some of these crap "flamers" would
    eventually start using their clubs as well!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13502.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13502.html</a></p>
