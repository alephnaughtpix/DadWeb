<p>Well, I think it's funny!!! Apparently the guys behind "Independence
    Day" are wanting to put the "President" character from there into an
    "Incredible Journey" remake!!! The heroes of the film get shrunk in
    "ZX Shrink Chamber"!!!!! (Actually, it looks like this rumour is a load
    of crap, but I still like the idea of a ZX Shrink Chamber!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/news/980708/6.html">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/news/980708/6.html</a></p>
