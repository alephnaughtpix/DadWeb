<p>There's a new MP3 player just getting underway called "FreeAMP"- Yep,
    that's right!!! It's "Free", because it's GPLed. If you dunno what
    that means, it just means you get the source code with it!!! This is how they
    usually do things in the world of Unix, but this proggy is done for
    Windows as well as Unix/Linux!!! At the moment, it's still in a very
    early stage- there ain't no binary versions, so you have to have the
    right tools to compile it for Windows!! But since you get the right tools
    supplied with Linux as standard, it should be no prob there!!! Anyway,
    it's worth keeping an eye on- hopefully when my WinAmp player has run out,
    they'll have done a binary version!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.freeamp.org/">http://www.freeamp.org/</a></p>
