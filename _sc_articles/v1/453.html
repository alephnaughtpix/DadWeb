<p>Some of you young persons might remember from a few weeks back this "Zing!" business, (See
    <a href="10.html#312"> issue 10</a>...) which includes clips from bands
    featured in "Rolling Stone", which appears to be a US music magazine
    for "real people" with "real feelings" who like to listen to really
    dull singer-songwriter type nonsense!!!!!!! The Rolling Stone Zing clips
    even manage to make Madonna and The Prodge sound dull-but-worthy!!!!!!
    So it's with a bit of dread that I read that Rolling Stone have launched
    their own web radio station!!!!!!!!!! Ah well, if you've got trouble
    with insomnia, you know which site to visit!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15921.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15921.html</a></p>
