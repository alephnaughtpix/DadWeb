<p>Well, you might be impressed by all those little palm computes, but how
    about this... A computer in a pen!!!!! BT has brought the really naffly-named
    "Smart Quill" is supposed to be able to read writing as you actually write!!!
    It slots into a special "inkwell", which allows it to connect to the "proper"
    computer, and downloads all your writing!!!! (Which is just as well, as the
    screen on the pen is a little small!!!!!!) Only prob with this... It'll
    need a really smart quill to be able to read *<b>my</b>* handwriting!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.innovate.bt.com/showcase/smartquill/">http://www.innovate.bt.com/showcase/smartquill/</a></p>
