<p><i>"This PlayStation and PC title is among a line of revived and revamped
    "vintage" titles at the show that also includes a remake of Centipede.
    This time around, you're working your laser cannon in 3-D, and those
    rocks can come at you from any side, or above, or below."</i></p><p>So that's what Hasbro having been doing with their Atari booty!!! Actually
    that versh of Asteriods sounds a bit hard to play!! If it's in 1st person,
    you're not going to be able to see all the rocks coming at you (especially
    from behind!!), and if it's in 3rd person, how are you going to tell what
    rocks are in frony of you or behind you, and how will you be able to tell in
    which direction towards or away from the screen your gun is pointing!??</p>
