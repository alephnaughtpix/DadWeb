    team that designed the smash hit Goldeneye. Players take the role of
    Joanne Dark, a cyberpunk-styled gunslinger in the year 2023, and blast
    away at big-headed aliens and other enemies, with the help of "real-time
    ray tracing" and "natural intelligence" technology."</i></p><p>Joanne Dark!!!! Perfect Dark!!! Ho ho, what a good pun!!!! Great, another 1st
    person shoot-em-up, and it's in a cyberpunk stylee as well!!! Let's hope they
