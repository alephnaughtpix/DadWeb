<p><i>"From the developers of Oddworld comes the sequel to Abe's
    Oddysee, another chapter in the series of side-scrolling "platform" adventure
    games starring Abe, an odd-but-lovable "Mudokon" who's also a hunchback. He
    uncovers a grim plot involving bones and beer. "</i></p><p>Wow, this sounds so wacky it could be a Japanese game!!! Mind you, it's side
    scrolling platform stuff, so it might only appeal to kids!!!</p>
