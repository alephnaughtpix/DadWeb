<p><i>"A third-person action adventure title set in 1906, where you play an
    Indiana Jones-type adventurer who descends into a hidden world through
    a fissure in a glacier. Put your hero through all kinds of neat movements,
    including hand-over-hand maneuvers along ledges and cables, and
    tricks with grappling hooks."</i></p><p>Dunno about this though- all this manouvering thru rocks and ice and stuff
    sounds a bit too complex for me!!! And it's in third-person!! Watch this
    flop!!!!</p>
