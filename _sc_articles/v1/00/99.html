<p><i>"The game that made Microsoft a serious player in the world of computer
    gaming as well as word processors will be back at the end of the year,
    pending US Justice Department approval. Strategy gaming fans will likely
    invest hours working through history from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance."</i></p><p>...Which sounds absolutely bloody boring, if you ask me!! What's this about
    Microsoft that they make such brilliant apps, yet when they turn their talents
    to games, they come up with really boring shit like Flight simulators or card
    games!! I think the Department of Justice should *really* be taking them to
    court for their mind-bendingly dull and boring games!!!!</p>
