<p><i>"Game-design legend John Romero's time-traveling action title takes
    fans of the "first-person shooter" genre from ancient Greece to futuristic
    space stations. Ultra smooth rendering of aliens, guns, enemies ...
    and more guns."</i></p><p>Woo, this is great!!!! I was just thinking: there's not enough Quake clones in
