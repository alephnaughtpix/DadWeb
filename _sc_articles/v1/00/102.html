<p><i>"You'll never run out of plastic with this game in which you
    assemble toys, cars, and anything else on screen from a bottomless
    bucket of virtual bricks. Once you're done, you can print out a diagram
    and give it to your friends."</i></p><p>Yeah!!!!! Who needs *real* lego when you can buy a Pentium 369MZh and
    Win98, and various sound and video cards, and Lego Builder!!! Sounds a lot
    more convenient to me!!!!!</p>
