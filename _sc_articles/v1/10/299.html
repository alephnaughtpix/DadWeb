<p>Now that our illustrious zine has entered the <b>E-Zine Webring</b>, We've
    been jumping around the ring randomly to see what the "competition"
    is like... And we found this magazine called "<b>Retrospective</b>"
    which is apparently a "groovy" mag for "teens"... Well, read it

    bloke writing it whilst listening to Radio 2!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://move.to/retrospective">http://move.to/retrospective</a></p><p>The Ezine Webring is in:<br/>
