<p>What would you do if you've got a whole load of of top secrets?!?!?! Put it on
    a website where everyone can see it of course!!!!!! Well, unless you're
    someone like the Pentagon!!!!!! They've just got round to realising that
    putting sensitive data on a publicly available website might not be a good
    idea!!!! And they're doing a search on their websites to check there's no
    secret stuff!!! "Loose lips sink ships" they say!!!! Well, of course loose
    lips sink ships- if they keep dribbling on long enough, it'll waterlog the
    ship and it'll sink!!!! But I don't see what that's got to do with the
    websites!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/intra-news/1998/09/1701-usa-pentagon.html">http://www.internetnews.com/intra-news/1998/09/1701-usa-pentagon.html</a></p>
