<p>So, you've just hacked into a super-duper computer, what do you do next?!?!
    Divert huge sums of money to your bank account!??!?! Write "Kilroy Woz
    'Ere" or something really "political" on the webpage ?!?!?!?
    No!!!!! You would of course use the computing power to compute extremely
    large prime numbers!!!!!! Well, that's one hacker did anyway!!!! Just before
    he got caught, anyway!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/15/uswest.hacker.ap/index.html">http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/15/uswest.hacker.ap/index.html</a></p>
