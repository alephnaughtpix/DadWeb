<p>This is great!!!! We haven't had so many laughs since "Killer Net"!!!! Some
    photographer noticed that someone had linked to a page which had linked to
    an unauthorised picture of Liz Taylor which he had made, and he tried to
    sue the person for linking to something which linked to it!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/websuit980921.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/websuit980921.html</a></p><p>And he was very surprised when the judge dismissed it!!! Ho ho!!!! Now they
    only need to do this in the UK with that "Shetland Times" business....</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/techweb/TW_Court_Dismisses_Web_Copyright_Case.html">http://www.nytimes.com/techweb/TW_Court_Dismisses_Web_Copyright_Case.html</a></p>
