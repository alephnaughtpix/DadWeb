<p>If I were to say to you that I could do a whole big long essay on
    postmodernism in a jiffy, you might think I was really clever, but I
    wouldn't be!!!!! And neither would the essay, as it would be a load of made
    up bollox!!!!! The only thing that would be really clever was that it would be
    made up by a computer program called the "<b>Dada Engine</b>" which was
    fixed up to act as a "Postmodern Essay Generator"!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/postmodern">http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/postmodern</a></p><p>Unfortunately the <b>Slashdot</b> crowd have just found out about it, so the
    resulting increase in traffic has probably killed the flippin' server!!!!!
    So just in case, here's a couple of example essays someone did earlier!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://crds.chemie.unibas.ch/~motyl/post/">http://crds.chemie.unibas.ch/~motyl/post/</a></p><p>Here's the whole "<b>Dada Engine</b>" thingy!!!! It works on Unix type
    systems, and you can use it to make convincing random texts in any style!!!!
    Hmmm... I wonder if the "lads" at <b>Loaded</b> mag use it to make up the
    letters for the letter pages!??!?! They certainly couldn't do much worse!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zikzak.net/~acb/dada/">http://www.zikzak.net/~acb/dada/</a></p>
