<p>Now this is getting ridiculous!!!!! Just as you thought that flippin'
    "Clinton" business was dying down now, this "comes" up!!!! Apparently not
    all the "white stuff" on the infamous Monica Lewinsky dress (ie The one that
    she didn't wash for two years!!!!) is not all what you might think- some of
    it is allegedly cocaine!!!!!! Anyway, also in this "story": apparently 25%
    of the staff have a "history" of drug use... Well come on, some of them must
    have come from 60s, so what do you expect!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/exclusiv/980922.exclu.html">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/exclusiv/980922.exclu.html</a></p>
