<p>Well, as the TV ad says, <i>"All you need is Sky"</i>!!!!! We don't know what
    Sky needs tho!!!!! Mind you, we know one thing they probably *<b>don't</b>*
    need and that's to be blown to bits by a rock from space!!!! But that might
    possibly happen in a couple of months, as the "Leonids" meteors hit the
    Earth!!!! They're actually quite small rocks, so they'll get burned up by the
    Earth's atmosphere, but they may hit satellites outside the atmos, and since
    they're travelling at a hefty speed, they may cause a little damage!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15193.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15193.html</a></p>
