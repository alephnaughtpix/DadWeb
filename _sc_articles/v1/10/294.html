<p>"Dr. Dennis Willows" from University of Washington wants to
    "implant a tiny silicon chip in a sea slug". And he's managed to get
    money from Microsoft to go right ahead and do it!!!!! You might wonder
    what's so great about sticking a silicon chip in a slug... Well, it's to
    see how it's memory works of course!!!! And to find a "man-machine" type
    computer-human interface that doesn't rely on Windows!!!!! So some time in
    the future we'll all be wearing red shirts and talking German like those
    cheeky Kraftwerk chappies with implanted chips running in our brains running
    Microsoft systems!!! Wow!!!! That will be something to look forward to!!! I
    just hope they fix the "Blue Screen of Death" by then tho!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14955.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14955.html</a></p>
