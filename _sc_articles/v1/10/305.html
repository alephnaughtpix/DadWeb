<p>Have you ever looked at these webpages and thought "I think they would go
    better if you squished them!!!!!" Well, that day may be not so far away!!!!
    Apache, the world's no. 1 webserver (So it's like The Spice Girls of
    webservers!!!) has got support for sending compressed webpages, but so far
    no web browser supported it- until now!!!!! The <b>Mozilla</b> project to
    make the next <b>Netscape</b> browser has included it- and since text files
    compress really well, this sort of thing can make a really big difference!!!!
    Neat-o or what-o?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/apache/gzip/">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/apache/gzip/</a></p>
