<p>You might remember Negativland and their lovely little website... (See <a href="9.html#266">issue
    9</a>...) Well, check this out from the "Coming Attractions" section!!! Among
    the things they are working on is:</p><blockquote>
<i>"<b>SECRET SINGLE</b>
<p>Something to do with a number one world wide hit single, a very popular
        childrens' televison show and...anarchism."</p></i>
</blockquote><p>Hmmmm.... I wonder what that could be!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.negativland.com/attractions/coming.html">http://www.negativland.com/attractions/coming.html</a></p><p>Unfortunately for them, <b>Cruel Site of the Day</b> has beat them to the
    idea!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cruel.com/images/unatubby.gif">http://www.cruel.com/images/unatubby.gif</a></p><p>Cruel Site of the Day is a really cool site BTW!!! Check it out at: <a href="http://www.cruel.com/">http://www.cruel.com/</a></p><p>BTW we've just found out that Negativland is actually named after some track
    by one of those "alternative" German groups from the early 70s!!!! Why they
    didn't name themselves after a more snappily-titled track like "Morgenspaziergang"
    we don't know!!!!!!!!</p>
