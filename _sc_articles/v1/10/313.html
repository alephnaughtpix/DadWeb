<p>Some "serious" porn mag has started up on the web!!!! Actually, this story
    isn't very interesting!!!!! We just mentioned it because the <b>Wired
    News</b> story covering it had this really hilarious paragraph in
    it!!!!!!!!!!!</p><blockquote>"For Field, pornography and erotica have
    become jaded. Too many lovers have
    warmed to the touch, purred like kittens,
    switched into high gear, and thought
    they were going to explode."</blockquote><p>Ooooh errrr, missus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15153.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15153.html</a></p>
