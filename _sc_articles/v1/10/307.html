<p>Well, you might impressed by how big HDs are getting in capacity whilst
    getting smaller (See <a href="9.html#270"> issue 9</a>...) but you soon
    won't be impressed!!! Why not?!?! Well, HD manufacturers expect disk drives
    will reach their limit of compactness by 2004!!! By then, they expect we'll
    have HDs that can store 8000 MB an inch!!!! Luckily they've got a little
    friend called "MO"!!! MO stands for "magneto-optical" or something technical
    like that....</p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/st4626.html">http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/st4626.html</a></p>
