<p>Have you ever wondered what Pacman would look like on a rotating cube?!?!?
    How about Frogger on a dodecahedran?!?! Or even Donkey Kong on an isoceles
    triangle?!?!?!??!?! Well, that day might not be so far away!!!!! Someone in
    the ultra-hip Linux "scene" has done a version of that spiffy arcade emulator
    <b>MAME</b> using <b>Open GL</b>, which means all those old games will be
    able to take advantage of all the lovely texture-mapping facilities on your
    ultra-hep 3D card!!!!! I can't to see Defender mapped on a 3D fourier
    transform of a transverse sine wave tho!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/%7Eoliphant/glmame/">http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/%7Eoliphant/glmame/</a></p>
