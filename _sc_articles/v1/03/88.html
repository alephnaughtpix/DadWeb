<p>Argh!!! According to a BBC Annual Report, the Beeb are
    wanting to update their BBC Online service to go away from just
    programme details to "to focus on genres and subjects"!!! Yahoo
    UK are apparently taking this idea as a serious threat- after all
    if the BBC do this well, then they're a direct competitor to Yahoo
    UK!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/13871.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/13871.html</a></p><p>While the hype's just starting here, over in the US, the Portal
    Honeymoon looks as thought it's over!!!! Some web designer are starting
    to get seriously cheesed off with Portals, and say they might actually
    slow things down, not speed 'em up!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13679.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13679.html</a></p>
