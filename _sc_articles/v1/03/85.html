<p>This is really wierd!!! A website has opened up on the eve of the
    German elections- it asks you a few questions about the issues of
    the day, and then it adds all the results up, and tells you what
    politcal views you support!!!! Er, hang on, wouldn't you know
    that already if you can answer those flippin questions?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/13955.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/13955.html</a></p>
