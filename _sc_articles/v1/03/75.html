<p>Interesting new Win95/98 virus!!! From Taiwan, no less (The new Belgium
    for virii?!?!), this one is apparently a completely new type of virus,
    the first since the first Word Basic viruses came out- it can wipe out
    Flash BIOS data, which of course will turn your PC into a not-very-smart
    unresponsive box!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.avp.com/about/press/062798/body_062798.html">http://www.avp.com/about/press/062798/body_062798.html</a></p>
