<p>You know how you search for something in a search engine, and you get a
    whole load of guff back that's completely irrelevant but has the same
    keywords?!? Well, some company called Direct Hit (<a href="http://www.directhit.com/)">http://www.directhit.com/)</a>
    is working with a few of the search engine to keep track of the sites
    that people actually select from search results, so that they can keep
    tabs on what's really relevant to people in search results!! Only prob I
    can see with that... what if different things are relevant in searches
    according to which country you come from or the language you speak and
    so on!?!? If people from the UK are looking for things to rub out pencil
    marks, they'll type "rubbers" into a search engine, and get condom sites
    from the US!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.directhit.com/">http://www.directhit.com/</a></p>
