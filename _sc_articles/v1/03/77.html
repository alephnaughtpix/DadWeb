<p>You know that big meteorite that hit Greenland last year?!?! Well,

    "Deep Impact", eh?!?! They're currently going on an expedition to
    actually go to the spot and check the meteor out or something.</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9807/16/meteorite.search/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9807/16/meteorite.search/index.html</a></p>
