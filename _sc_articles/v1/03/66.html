<p>In case you haven't seen this from the <a href="../../../faq.html">SD FAQ</a>
    yet... If you've got Realaudio (Assuming it hasn't been killed by the Realplayer
    Killer yet!!!!), you can listen to an album that doesn't exist!!!! Enough
    tracks have surfaced from the long lost Beach Boys album "Smile" that their fans
    can now make an educated guess at what the finished album sounds like!!!
    And yep, someone's put the whole bloody thing online in Realaudio and
    MP3 format!!!</p><p><a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~annew/smile/index.htm">http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~annew/smile/index.htm</a></p>
