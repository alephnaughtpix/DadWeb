<p>Troma, the bunch of dudes who do really cheap movies like "Class of Nuke
    'Em High" and "Toxic Avenger" have now got a little site on tha webby!!!
    Apparently they're planning to have a live webcast of 4 days worth of
    the filming schedule of their new prod "Terror Firmer"!!! And you'll
    be able to send comments to the crew there as well, and they're planning
    to add some some sort of interactive element to it as well, like deciding
    what to say etc... Sounds pretty interesting!!! Mind you, getting the
    online masses as production consultants certainly seems to fit in well
    with Troma's reputation for being really cheap!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.troma.com/">http://www.troma.com/</a></p>
