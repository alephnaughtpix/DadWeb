<p>The US Navy decided to get some computers in to take over shipboard
    functions, but one ship ran into a problem when the <b>Windows NT</b> system which
    it was running on crashed!!! Serves them right for trying to run
    someone else's system on their machines!!! They really should be
    doing their own system- I mean the military did their own networking
    system, and it resulted in the Internet!!! Who knows what kick-ass
    stuff would result if they tried to make their own system?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.gcn.com/gcn/1998/July13/cov2.htm">http://www.gcn.com/gcn/1998/July13/cov2.htm</a></p>
