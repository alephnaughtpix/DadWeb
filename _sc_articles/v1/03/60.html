<p>Who's this funny bloke?!?! Well, it's not really a who but a what!!! It's
    actually a wireless local area network being developed by Carnegie Mellon
    Uni!!! Apparently, the network is set up a bit like a cellphone type network,
    and can handle 2 megabits of data a sec!!! Now, that would be a pretty
    impressive network to connect your little palm computer to!!! The
    name "Wireless Andrew" apparently refers to Andrew Carnegie and Andrew
    Mellon, who, yup!, founded Carnegie Mellon uni!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_science_and_technology.html">http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_science_and_technology.html</a></p><p>Also on tha wireless tip are Hyperwave, who are doing wireless networks for
