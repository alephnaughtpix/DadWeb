<p>The writers in CNN-webland are getting in a bit of a strop because
    we're near the end of the 90s and no-one's yet thought of some catch-all
    phrase for the entire decade that's stuck!!! Well, looking at some of
    the "nominations", I'm not too surprised!!! I mean, how about "The Decade
    of Republicanism and common sense" - Yeah, means quite a lot to people
    like me in Central Scotland!!! Best of the lot isn't too good either-
    "Age of Information"- but at least it's a bit nearer the mark!!!</p><p>Let's try a couple of names ourselves... Erm, the "Netty" Nineties!?!?
    I heard on a radio prog about there being a "Niagra" of info on the
    web, so... "Netty Niagra Info Ninties?!?!" Erm, this is a bit difficult!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/US/9807/21/naming.the.90s.ap/index.html">http://cnn.com/US/9807/21/naming.the.90s.ap/index.html</a></p>
