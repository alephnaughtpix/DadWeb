<p>OK, you probably know by now that this zine is influenced by the likes
    of Need To Know (<a href="http://www.ntk.net/)">http://www.ntk.net/)</a> and various news trolls services,
    but look at this!!! Another web/email newsletter with links to various
    web stuffs and various comments. It's called "The Mezzenger", and I
    don't think it's quite as good as ours, but then I would say that,
    wouldn't I!??! The style's more like some Amiga/PC style diskmag
    articles, but some of the links are pretty cool, so it's all right
    really!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.themezz.com/news">http://www.themezz.com/news</a></p>
