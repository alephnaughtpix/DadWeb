<p>Well, it's great to see the US have really unhealthy little greasy
    spoons cafes!!! In fact there's a whole chain of them called "White
    Castle"!! But as you see when you load the "unofficial" page below,
    the "burgers" look the exact same as the classic cafe square sausage
    stuck in a morning roll!!! The guy who does this page must be almost
    as fat as the dude who does "Ain't It Cool News"!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.shadow.net/~colbert/wcmain.html">http://www.shadow.net/~colbert/wcmain.html</a></p><p>The offical site is here, but I don't think it looks quite as good...</p><p><a href="http://www.whitecastle.com/">http://www.whitecastle.com/</a></p>
