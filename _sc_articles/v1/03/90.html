<p>This is a very strange story!!! One of the head guys from Real Audio
    demonstrated what appeared to be MS doing the nasty on them!! He
    installed MS Media Player, and RealPlayer didn't work anymore!! The
    reason it's strange is that MS has a 10% stake in Real Audio, and
    some of the technology in the Media player is licenced from Real
    Audio!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/all/9807234realnet">http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/all/9807234realnet</a></p><p><b>Update</b>- It appears it's really the fault of RealAudio!!!
    Apparently the RealPlayer doesn't set the Windows Registry properly!!!
    So Microsoft are completely blameless on this!!!</p><p>For some reason, when I told one of my anti-MS conspiracy-loving friends
    this little titbit, he went "Aha!! I thought so!!!" I don't know why he
    said that tho!!!</p>
