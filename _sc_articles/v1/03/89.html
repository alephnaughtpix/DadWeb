<p>Well, if you can get over to San Francisco really quickly, you can
    go and watch some robots fighting each other!!!! Yep, a couple of
    decades after all those hippies went all on about love and stuff, you
    can go to "Robotica", a convention for, erm, fighting robots!!! It takes place
    at some big shed called "The Cow Palace"!!! I don't think any cows would
    want to be in it what with those murderous robots around!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.clineworks.com/robotica.html">http://www.clineworks.com/robotica.html</a></p>
