<p>Yep, it might be raining here in sunny Scotland, but it's nice to know
    it rains a lot in other places, so I'm dead pleased to find out about
    the The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission website!!! Even more
    interesting is that when I was last on, they appear to have worked out
    that El Nino has collapsed and appears to be turning into La Nina!!! So
    that's the weather buzzword for the next year- La Nina!!! You heard it
    here first!!!!</p><p><a href="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a></p>
