<p>Erm, there's supposed to be some satirical magazine from Scotland called
    "Scotland The Raw"!! Only prob, I can't find the flippin thing yet!!! There's
    two URLs I've seen for this thingy, but they don't really lead anywhere!!!
    Maybe they will soon, I heard of it on Sunday, which is <i>before</i> the first
    issue is supposed to go out!!! But ATM it isn't out!!! And I don't know
    when it's out!!!!! Erm!!!</p><p>BTW When I heard of it on Sunday, it was courtesy of an interview with it's
    editor in a Sunday broadsheet- it's online at <a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/98/07/19/stiecoeco03003.html?1334425">http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/98/07/19/stiecoeco03003.html?1334425</a> !!!</p><p>And that's without an issue!!! Senior Citizen has already released released 3
    issues- the broadsheets really ought to be beating a path to our doors!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm">http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm</a> - This appears to be just an advert
    for the thingy plus an addr to subscribe to (presumably an ASCII versh),
    but I hope the finished product doesn't look like that!! Especially since,
    according to the interview, the editor is a "co-partner in a web design
    and game design agency"!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com</a> - ATM this has 
    some message along the lines
    of "This domain name has been registered!!!" and then some ad that reads
    like one of those Make Money Fast ads!!!</p><p><b>Update (24/7/98)</b>- It's still not appeared, but now there's a little message on the first 
    link saying "Late transmition to allow the competition to exhaust themselves !" I hope they're not 
    exhausted even before they begin!!!</p>
