<p>One example of the wacky stories that the above site covers...
    Pie Menus!!! They're like normal menus, but circular!!! I
    can't really see the point of them in replacing normal menus,
    but stuff like the "colour selection wheel" where it would help
    to have the thing in a circular shape would benefit from this
    sort of thing... What next tho?!? Rhomboid menus!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://catalog.com/hopkins/piemenus/ddj/piemenus.html">http://catalog.com/hopkins/piemenus/ddj/piemenus.html</a></p>
