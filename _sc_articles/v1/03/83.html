<p>While a conference of record industry moguls weren't too keen on
    the MPEG audio format saying they thought it was only good for
    music piracy (As opposed cassette tapes?!?!?) and other excuses,
    one major label has gone right ahead and put a preview MP3
    of one of their acts online as a preview promo for the album,
    which you can order online!!! Well, er come to think of it, isn't
    that what they call a single!?!? Anyway, don't get too excited it's
    just some swing band from the US, so if you're into a load wierd
    guys playing double bass and stuff, don't let me stop you!!!</p><p><a href="http://content.mp3.com/mp3/visitors/browse/detail518.asp">http://content.mp3.com/mp3/visitors/browse/detail518.asp</a></p><p>Just in case you're wondering, this is different from the Rialto
    "Internet" single "Monday Morning 5:19", because although you get
    it from an Internet site, it's not an MP3, it's just an ordinary single
    that you buy over the Internet!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.imvs.com/features/rialto/">http://www.imvs.com/features/rialto/</a></p>
