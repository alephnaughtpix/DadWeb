<p>The "Our First Time" site (As seen as in Issue 2) suddenly disappeared
    on Saturday as apparently their ISP pulled the plug on it!!! Then it
    re-appeared later in the day on a different ISP!!! According to the
    original ISP hoster, the site's a hoax!!! (Wow, that was a bit hard
    to guess, wasn't it!??!) Apparently the man behind the site was
    intending to charge viewers 5 dollars to view, and then "Mike" and
    "Diane" would decide *not* to do it!!!! Apparently this was a plot
    to annoy the hell (!!!) out of religious fundy types and say something
    about safe sex and make money all at the same time!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13816.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13816.html</a></p><p>But it gets better!!! As soon as the "new" site went up, it was
    broken into by a hacker called "MagicFX", who deleted the entire
    site, and replaced it with a slaggy message to the man behind it!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13831.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13831.html</a></p><p>Earlier this week "Mike" and "Diane" came forth from the shadows to
    reveal themselves as Ty Taylor, a 23 yo actor, and Michelle Parma (of
    unspecified age!!) who's appeared in some MTV show or something, and
    guess wot!!! They're neither 18 or virgins!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13904.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13904.html</a></p>
