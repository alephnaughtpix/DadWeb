<p>Remember those blipverts from the "Max Headroom" movie?!?! Well, in
    the US, they've already got round to the ONE SECOND COMMERCIAL!!! The
    first on the blocks was a padlock maker called MasterLock!!!! The only
    prob is that you can't do too much in 1 second, unless you do subliminal
    stuff, which ain't allowed here or in the US!!! The way they got around
    the subliminal bit was pretty sneaky tho- they simply used a slightly
    greater rate of frames in their ad!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/4337.htm">http://www.nypost.com/business/4337.htm</a></p>
