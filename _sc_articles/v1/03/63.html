<p>Actually I found the above newsletter in John Labovitz's e-zine-list,
    which, contains loads of links to various e-zines, some really very
    strange!!! (eg "The Daily Lung", which is a newsletter about lung
    disease!!) So, it's not all boring pretentious "post-modern"
    "counter-culture" "arts" "journals", man!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.meer.net/~johnl/e-zine-list/">http://www.meer.net/~johnl/e-zine-list/</a></p>
