<p>They'd better be quick tho!!! Why?!?! Well, how's this for a nightmare scenario then!?!? The Pentagon are a
    little worried that the Russian nukes early warning system might
    get a little confused by the coming millenium and shoot their load!!!
    (ie fire off the nukes, you dirty person!!!!) The Pentagon are thinking
    of lending a hand... Mind you, I don't know about this "division by zero"
    problem... I mean, how do you test for an outside missle attack by
    dividing by the year?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/asp/redir.asp?/tool/html/98/jul/0717/feat.htm">http://www.forbes.com/asp/redir.asp?/tool/html/98/jul/0717/feat.htm</a></p>
