<p>Looks like Macromedia are really pushing out the boat on publicising
    their prods!!!! They've just started a Shockwave powered site called
    "ShockRAVE"!!! It also uses Real Audio as well, so who know how much
    those Real dudes and Microsoft are paying as well!!! It's not just
    gimmicky display site either- there's like real actual dance music
    bands playing on it as well!!! One major problem i'm finding with it tho, is
    that for some wacky reason, they're pumping out the sound at a really loud
    volume and hurting my poor eardrums!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.shockrave.com/">http://www.shockrave.com/</a></p>
