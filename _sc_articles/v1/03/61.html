<p>You know those Wal-Mart dudes!?!? You know, the ones that edit the Prodigy
    albums of all the naughty words because it might harm people and instead
    stock nice wholesome family things like guns!!! Well, looks like they've
    shot themselves in the foot!!! One shop sold guns to a couple of teenagers,
    who used it in a robbery and killed someone!!! The person's widow then sued
    sucessfully Walmart for selling the teenagers the guns!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/US/9807/19/briefs/ammunition.sales.ap/index.html">http://cnn.com/US/9807/19/briefs/ammunition.sales.ap/index.html</a></p>
