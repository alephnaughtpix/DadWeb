<p>Now some of you readers might have occasionally had their disk drive filling up, and 
    have had to get rid of all the rubbish files on the drive to get more 
    space!!!!!!!!! Well, whatever you do, don't get rid of your back copies 
    of <b>SENIOR CITIZEN</b>!!!!!!!!! Erm, anyway!! If you've had that problem, 
    then you might want to give advice to NASA!!!!! That's because NASA 
    are currently having a bit of a problem with storing all the data from 
    their records!!!!!! They're especially having problems with updating 
    out of date data formats- it takes four years to convert to new data 
    format which will probably have to be converted again within 6 years 
    anyway!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/1999/0125/fcw-newsstorage-1-25-99.html">http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/1999/0125/fcw-newsstorage-1-25-99.html</a></p>
