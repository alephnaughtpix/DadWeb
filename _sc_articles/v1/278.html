<p>One of the best sites on Grelb (RIP!!!) apart from us of course, and that "Meg
    Ryan" site, and... well, erm, anyway!!!! The site we're talking about was a
    site by a bloke called <b>Sam Kington</b> and the actual site name of this
    site which in this site resides was called "Mung"!!!! And it was a clever
    little proggy which loaded webpages and translated it using wierd filters-
    what was really clever was that the links would also go through the filter!!!</p><p>Then that disappeared, and we couldn't find any equivalents on tha w3!!!
    (Which was really annoying as we were wanting to an equivalent on our site
    allowing you to translate webpages into <b>Doddering Git</b>'s "<i>k3Wl
    wAy33 oV sAy1Ng tH1nGzZz!!1!!</i>", and we couldn't find any code to rip
    off!!!!) Until now, that is!!!!! The "<b>Dialectizer</b>" also processes all
    your webpages into cockney, Swedish Chef, and so on... It's apparently done
    by some bloke called <b>Samuel Stoddard</b>!!! Hmmmm.....</p><p><a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect/">http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect/</a></p>
