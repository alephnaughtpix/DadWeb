<p>Have you seen one of those "modern art" thingies (Like "Cow Pat Cut In Half" by
    Damien Hirst or whatever it is!!!!!!!!!) and thought <i>"I can do that shit,
    completely at random!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?!?! Well, you'd be right, because here's a
    site dedicated to creating art that's as modern as you can get, and it does it
    completely at random!!!!!!! No, it's not one of those "fractal" places!!!!!!! Erm...
    well, actually, it's a bit like that, really!!!!!!! It's the <b>Gallery of Random
    Art</b>!!!!!!! It generates funny little pictures randomly using the almighty
    power of mathematics!!!!!!!!! And you can vote on the best and worst of them, and
    the best are kept for posterity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://gs211.sp.cs.cmu.edu/art/random/index.html">http://gs211.sp.cs.cmu.edu/art/random/index.html</a></p>
