<p>Well, you might be eagerly playing "Tiger Woods 99 PGA World Tour" whilst searching 
    for the South Park anim on it, (See <a href="2.html#657"> issue 2</a>...) 
    but what if you're a really really crap player?!?!?!?!? Well, you might 
    want to read this publication called "<b>Bad Golfing Monthly</b>"!!!!!! 
    So if you get a "birdie", then you don't need to be too worried!!!!!! 
    Unless of course the RSPCA is in the area!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.badgolfmonthly.com/">http://www.badgolfmonthly.com/</a></p>
