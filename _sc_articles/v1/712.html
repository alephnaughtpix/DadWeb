<p>Have you ever wanted to go on a bicycle and cycle faster than the speed of 
    light!?!?!?!?!?!? Don't woryy, you won't need Sir Clive Sinclair to make you 
    a powered "zike" which has infinite energy!!!!!!!!!!!!! You just need these 
    people in the following article to slow down the apparent speed of light for 
    you!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Well, actually, they of course do not actually slow down the speed of light, 
    as that's always at the.. erm, speed of light!!!!!!!! They actually stick the 
    light through a cloud of atoms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the effect of sticking 
    loadsa atoms in the way slows down the transmission of light to a puny 17 metres 
    a second!!!!!!!!!  Why not just stick a brick wall in front of the light beams-
    that would slow it down to zero metres per second, wouldn't it?!?!?!?!?!?
