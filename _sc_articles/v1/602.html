<p>But they'll need 
    to speed up!!!!! Because this other lot are catching up... at the speed 
    of light!!!!!!!!! That's because the first actual proper "light beams" 
    chip has been launched!!!! It's called a "photonic chip", and it "photonic 
    wires" to distribute, erm, photons!!!!! So don't shine your torch at
