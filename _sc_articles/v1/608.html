<p>Well, apparently 
    there are too many web awards around, and so the "proper" ones aren't 
    getting taken seriously!!!!!! At least so say this lot who do a web 
    awards called the "<b>Webby</b>"!!!!!!!!!!! Erm, somehow I think the 
    real reason they're not being taken seriously is because they're called 
    the "Webby"!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16720.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/<br/>
