<p>As we mentioned before, there are some loopy survivalist types, who see the Y2K bug 
    as the lastest candidate for causing society to break down!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="4.html#109"> issue 4</a>...) So it's no surprise to see this 
    person pitching in!!!!!!! Apparently he's been predicting the apocalypse 
    for years!!!! Only one thing tho- he keeps changing the date and the 
    cause of the apocalypse!!!!! At the moment it's Y2K, but if he gets 
    that one wrong, then he'll probably change again and predict a big meteorite 
    or whatever!!!! What he doesn't say that much is that the reason he's 
    wanting the apocalypse to get a bloody move on is that he's wanting 
    to meet Jesus or something!!!! Why he doesn't instead just place an 
    ad in the personal ad section in a newspaper is anyone's guess!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/17193.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/17193.html</a></p>
