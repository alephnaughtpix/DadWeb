<p>Imagine you're 
    an important lawyer person in Arizona!!!! What sort of flagship law 
    would you try and get passed?!?!?!?! Well, how about a law banning the 
    successor to the Intel Pentium II processor?!?!?!?!?!? Well, that's 
    what this law-person has done!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,31482,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.e">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,31482,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.e</a> </p><p>You might notice from that article that there's a privacy issue 
    involved!!!! Apparently each of these new Pentium III chips has a 
    unique serial ID, and this can be found out by software, which means 
    that when you're online, outside software can potentially track you 
    as your surf using the ID number in your Pentium III chip!!!!!!!! 
    Some people are now calling a boycott on Intel groups!!!!! 
  <p>Faced with all this, Intel has decided it would a nice idea (Especially 
    for their factories in Arizona!!!!!!) back down a bit.... Apparently, 
    you'll be able to "switch off" the reporting of the ID num!!!!!!!! 
    But the number's still there!!!!!!!! So, the privacy groups are still 
    not pleased!!!!!!! And the boycott is still going on!!!!!!!! </p>
