<p>You know that from Gillette for their <i>"Mach 3"</i> razor?!?!?!? You know,
    the one where some young bloke is in this supersonic jet fighter, and when it
    goes to mach 3, suddenly the jet blows up, and all his clothes get ripped
    off!!!! Then he mysteriously turns up in this room where he decides to have a
    shave!!!!!!!!!!! Well, like me, you might be wondering about the logical basis
    behind this advert, but one thing is sure- it'll soon be out of date!!!!!!!!!
    That's because some clever people are working on a plane that is
    capable supersonic flight at the speed of mach *<b>5</b>*!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
    you'll be able to go from Tokyo to Los Angeles in 4 hours!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope
    they'll have enough time to make a quick stop-off at our town tho!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0209sc22.htm">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0209sc22.htm</a></p>
