<p>Say, you're the manager of a band, and you want to record all their "gigs" in
    digital audio... You'd have a lot of "gigs" on your hard drive!!!!!!!!!! But
    if you had this hard drive, you'd have 100 of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's
    because we are of course not really talking about "gigs", but
    "gigabytes"!!!!!!!!!!! Someone's just done a 100 Gig HD drive!!!!!!!!! Mind
    you, you'd probably be able to store at least a 100 actual "gigs" on this
    HD!!! Just as long as they weren't all 2 hours long or anything!!!!!! If you
    were <b>The Orb</b> or something, you'd probably be able to store a few "gigs"
    on it though.</p><p><a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/inside_sources/99.2/99.2.5.phtml#SeagateBreaksHardDriveRecord">http://www.maximumpc.com/inside_sources/99.2/99.2.5.phtml#SeagateBreaksHardDriveRecord</a></p>
