<p>Now, the impression you might get from some games "mags" is that people in the
    games industry have big egos, like they're rock stars or something!!!!!!!! If
    so, no doubt you'll be a bit surprised to learn that one game company is
    really ashamed of one of it's games, and is trying to say sorry for it!!!!!!!
    <b>Sierra</b> released <b>NFL Football Pro '99</b>, and then decided to recall
    all 50,000 copies because it was buggy!!!!!!! They then to people that had
    already bought a full refund and free game, or patches and a discount toward
    buying the next version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Mind you, they are called "Sierra"!!!!!!!!!! If your company is named after a
    crap 70s car, then you probably don't have too many problems with your
    ego!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1999-02/01/044l-020199-idx.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1999-02/01/044l-020199-idx.html</a></p>
