<p>Well, one prize that hunters may want to "bag" is the Loch Ness
    Monster!!!!!!!! The only prob is that it's not exactly been sporting enough
    to give "Nessie" hunters a fair chance to blow it away it with a machine
    gun!!!!!!! But thanks to this lovely site, you can now see a live videocam of
    Loch Ness, and watch out for any "beasties"!!!!!! I bet we'll see loads of
    people "spotting" a dark pixel somewhere on a webcam picture, and if it goes
    away on the next picture, they'll say they've seen the monster!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.lochness.co.uk/livecam/">http://www.lochness.co.uk/livecam/</a></p>
