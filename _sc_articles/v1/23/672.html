<p>Here's an interesting 
    ideads site- and for a change it's actually from Britain this time!!!!!!!!! 
    However, there's one prob- this spiffy UK new ideas site is called <b>Hotbox</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    (!!!!!) We were half expecting to hear lewd and suggestive noises when 
    we got onto this website!!!!!!!!!!! But it's not like that!!!!!!!! There 
    are in fact a lot of interesting "hardware" ideas- and not the sort 
    of you thinking dirty persons!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p> One interesting idea is to transform any b/w photo into the first 
    few thousand numbers of <b>Pi</b>, arranged in such a way as to look 
    like the original photo!!!!!!!!!!! So, if you're ever calculating 
    the circumference of a circle, and you're wondering what the first 
    few thousand numbers of Pi are (in order to be really accurate!!!!), 
    you can just look very carefully at this special photograph of yourself, 
    and find out!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.hotbox.co.uk/">http://www.hotbox.co.uk/</a></p>
