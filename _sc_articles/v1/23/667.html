<p>Have you ever wanted what sort of clothes "The Gimp" from "Pulp Fiction" might wear 
    in the future!?!?!?! Well, he might wear these clothes, as he'll be 
    able to run "Gimp" on it!!!!!!!!!!! Because these clothes have <i>"the 
    computational power of a UNIX workstation"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, that's 
    right, they're wearable computes!!!!!!!!!!! You'll proably need to type 
    "startclothes &amp;" at the command line to put them on tho!!!!!
