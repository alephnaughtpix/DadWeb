<p>Only in America, as they say- in the business!!!!!!!!! Apparently some game
    called <b>"Deer Avenger"</b> has been shifting quite a lot of "units" in the
    US!!!!!!! And quite a lot of people are annoyed about it!!!!!!!! That's
    because it's a pisstake of hunter in America!!!!!!!!!! And for some reason
    hunters in America don't quite seem to get the joke!!!!!!!!!!! They're
    actually calling for a boycott of the game company!!!!!!!!!! Er, hang on!!! If
    they're hunters, then surely they'll be out all the time, and won't be playing
    computer games!!!!!!!!!!!! So a boycott wouldn't really make that much
    difference would it?!??!?!?!?!?! Anyway, they're all huffy and stuff, and are
    say things like: <i>"we do care for the environment, we do care for children
    and family morals."</i> In which case, I'd like to be there when they explain
    to their children why it's really moral to go out and blast Bambi's brains
    out!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17712.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17712.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
