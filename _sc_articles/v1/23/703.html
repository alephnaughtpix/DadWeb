<p>Some of you might possibly remember that delightful program <b>"The Twilight
    Zone"</b>!!!!!!!!! (In fact, it has been said by some that I am worthy
    cnadidate for such a zone- which I presume to be some sort of compliment, as
    it certainly makes no sense to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Well, if the presenter Rod
    Serling was a "soccer" player, he might have called it "Zone 14"
    instead!!!!!!!! That's because apparently "Zone 14" is a really really
    important place on the football field during a match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where it
    is I do not know, but apparently that's where the final game of the last world
    Cup was won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's porbably why some of the Brazilian team were
    arguing with each other late in the match!!!!!! They were probably saying:
    "We're not playing in Zone 14 enough, guys!!!!!!!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19990209/newscien/918518460-1342496802.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19990209/newscien/918518460-1342496802.html</a></p>
