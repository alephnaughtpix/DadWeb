<p>Well, let's hope MS don't patent these next "sheets"!!!!!!!!!!! Because these
    are sheets- of human skin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, artificial human skin,
    actually!!!!!!! Yes, apparently some company in Japan is going to start
    producing "skin sheets" of artificial skin for medical uses!!!!!! Does that
    mean when someone gets a skin graft from one of these sheets, they'll be
    "thick skinned"?!?!?!?!?!? (Doh!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0209sc06.htm">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0209sc06.htm</a></p>
