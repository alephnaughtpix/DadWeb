<p>You'll probably remember that jolly nice Ashford &amp; Simpson song from the 80s that we 
    might have mentioned previously.... (See <a href="6.html#180"> issue 
    6</a>...) Well, if that song was recorded today, it would now go: <i>"And 
    now we're solid!!!!!!!!! (Wooh!!! Yeah!!! etc) Solid as a hard drive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i> 
    That's because these really clever people have made a <b>solid state</b> 
    hard-drive which doesn't move or anything!!!!!!!! It would certainly 
    make a difference from the old banger in Godzilla's innards, as I always 
    keep saying!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.quantum.com/products/ssd/">http://www.quantum.com/products/ssd/</a></p>
