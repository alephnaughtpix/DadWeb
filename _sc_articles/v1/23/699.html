<p>As you might know, that super-dupey K6 Pentium thingy in your PC box
    does generate a lot of heat!!!!!!!!! If you were an "enviromentally freindly"
    type person, you'd probably be able to use the heat generated to boil water so
    you can have a nice cup of tea!!!!!!!!! Or stick a small wind-power generator
    next to the fan in order to power your computer!!!!!!!!!!! But have you ever
    thought about using it as a fridge?!?!??!?!!? Well, this lot appear to be
    working on it!!!!!!!!! Here you can read about people experimenting with a
    really efficient heat-sink!!!!!!!!!! In fact, it's so efficient, it actually
    generates frost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which would be really great on a summer days
    when I want to store ice cubes for my "ginger beer", but unfortunately, in
    current weather conditions, it would give me hypothermia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://kairos.dsa.uqam.ca/software/heatsink/">http://kairos.dsa.uqam.ca/software/heatsink/</a></p>
