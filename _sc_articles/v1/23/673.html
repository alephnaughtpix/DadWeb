<p>When you chuck the rubbish into the bin, have you ever thought: <i>"It's a shame I 
    don't have a barcode reader with me, or I would be able to scan the 
    items, and post the results on the Internet, so that everyone would 
    know what's in my rubbish bin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>!??!?!?! Well, that 
    what this guy has done!!!!!!!!!!!! In fact, he's wired up his toilet, 
    as well as a few video cams in his house, to the megamighty Inphopipeweb!!!!!!!! 
    So now you can find out when gets food out of the fridge, when he eats 
    it and throws away the wrapper into the bin, and when it comes out at 
    the other end and he flushes the toilet!!!!! You can even see a webcam 
    of his PC desktop, and find out what he's playing in Winamp!!!!!!! (When 
    we looked, it was: "Find a way to my heart" by Phil Collins- groovy!!!!)</p><p>This site has also been mentioned in Slashdot!!!!! Quite a few people 
    noted that he was using Windows 95 and various Microsoft stuffs, leading 
    to the really odd commment from someone: <i>"I'd rather have a house 
    without windows"</i>!!!!!!!! Won't it be a bit dark then?!?!?!??!!</p><p><a href="http://www.icepick.com/">http://www.icepick.com/</a></p>
