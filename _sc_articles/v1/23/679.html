<p>Only joking!!!!!!!!!!! 
    But some people aren't!!!!!!!!!!!! Since that "Good Times" virus scare 
    a couple of years ago, there seems to be lots of people who keep passing 
    on these silly messages that say something like <i>"If you see a message 
    with the subject "TEST", don't read it!!!!!! It contains the computer 
    equivalent of BSE, and it will destroy your hard drive, then send your 
    processor into an nth complexity binary loop that will cause the chip 
    to collapse in on itself and generate a minature black hole, which will 
    destroy your computer, before decaying through quantum leakage into 
    a nuclear explosion, equivalent to 5 megatons!!!!!! Then you'll get 
    squished by a meteorite."</i>!!!!!!!!!!! The viruses are obviously bogus, 
    but that doesn't stop people forwarding these messages on!!!!!!!!! In 
    fact, some people say that it's the *<b>messages</b>* that are really 
    the viruses themselves!!!!!! Anyway, if you want to find out about all 
    the various types of these really stupid messages, then go to this interesting 
    page!!!!!!!!! And you'd better be quick!!!!!!!! Because if you continue 
    to read this message, a virus will erase you from time and space!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Only joking!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.datafellows.com/news/hoax.htm">http://www.datafellows.com/news/hoax.htm</a></p>
