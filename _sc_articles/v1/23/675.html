<p>People always say I look as if I'd been through "the wars"!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, they're 
    right!!!!!!!!!!!!! But the same might happen to you if you go online!!!!!!!! 
    That because apparently the first online military action between two 
    countries has taken place!!!!!!!! And the two countries are: West Timor 
    vs East Timor!!!!!!!!!! If you don't know, West Timor occupies East 
    Timor and says to the rest of the world that it's really part of West 
    Timor!!!!!! Some people from East Timor who are a little miffed-off 
    at this state of affairs started a server based in Ireland for their 
    protests, and this week people from West Timor launched a hacking attack 
    against it!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_263000/263169.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_263000/263169.stm</a></p>
