<p>Now, I bet you never thought of your fridge as something you'd take to the
    shop with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, I don't normally do this myself, except of
    course when our local supermarket manager decided to run a jokey "All shopping
    is free if you bring your fridge with you!!!!!!!" type stunt for Red Nose
    Day!!!! (I decided to lay on a van service for all the people at the Old
    Folk's Home so that they could bring their fridges along!!!!!!!! The manager
    wasn't too pleased!!!!!!!!! However, as I explained to the police afterwards,
    the real trouble started when I suggested to the manager that perhaps he ought
    to cheer up a bit and wear a red nose or something, after all it was Red Nose
    Day, wasn't it!!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p>Ahem, anyway!!!!!!!!! If you've never taken the fridge to the shops, you might
    do so in future, and the manager will actually be pleased as well!!!!!!!!
    That's because you're not really taking the fridge to the shops, you're taking
    the shops to your fridge!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Some bright sparks have come up with
    this touch-screen thingy for fridges, called... (Check this original
    name out!!!!!!!) "<b>Fridgescreen</b>", which apparently links to an online
    shopping service!!!!!!!!! Only prob is- what happens if you put those funny
    fridge magnets on the fridge?!?!?!? Won't it erase Fridgescreen's data or
    something like that!??!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_276000/276870.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_276000/276870.stm</a></p>
