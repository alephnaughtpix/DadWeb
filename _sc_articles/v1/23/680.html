<p>How we managed 
    to miss this little gem we don't know!!!!!!! Remember we noted previously 
    that <b>Wired News</b> were starting to get a little more tabloidy and 
    hysterical?!??!?!! (See <a href="23.html#665"> issue 23</a>...) Well, 
    check this one out!!!!!!!! Here's the opening para from a recent article 
    entitled "Cracking the Mind of the hacker": </p><blockquote>"The average computer cracker is an obsessive
    middle-class white male, between 12 and 28 years old, with few social
    skills and a possible history of physical and sexual abuse."</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/17427.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/17427.html?wnpg=all</a></p><p>Yup, sounds like a completely reasonable unbiased non-hysterical statement to
    us as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, surprisly, some crackers/hackers/whatever
    Wired decides to call them these days!!!/who cares?!?!? are a little put out
    by this article!!!!!!!!!! So here's a complete slag-off of it!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.attrition.org/errata/www/art.0076.html">http://www.attrition.org/errata/www/art.0076.html</a></p>
