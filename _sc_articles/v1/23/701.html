<p>I was watching 
    this amusing little "Doctor Who" story the other night called "The Romans"!!!!!!!!! 
    It was quite good, but I noticed the Doctor forgot to say to the Emperor 
    Nero: <i>"Oh by the way, one of you Emperor dudes will lend his name 
    to a virus on Microsoft Word programs!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i> That's because 
    someone's done an MS Word virus called <b>Caligula</b>!!!!!!!!! It's 
    a bit like that <b>picture.exe</b> trojan (See <a href="22.html#654"> 
    issue 22</a>...) in that it sends some text to someone on tha netweb!!!!!! 
    Only here, it isn't an email address in China!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's actually 
    some website called <b>CodeBreakers</b>, and it sends your PGP keyring, 
    if you have one!!!!!!!!!! It's not much use without your actual PGP 
    passcode, but this CodeBreakers just decided to do this just to show 
    it was possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.info-sec.com/viruses/99/viruses_020999a_j.shtml">http://www.info-sec.com/viruses/99/viruses_020999a_j.shtml</a></p><p>Here's the Codebreakers site- are they really naughty, or what?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.codebreakers.org/">http://www.codebreakers.org/</a></p>
