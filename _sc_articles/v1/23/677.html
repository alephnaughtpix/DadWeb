<p>Hello readers!!!!!! 
    Have you ever wanted to spy on neurons?!?!?!? Or listen to amplifiers 
    smaller than grains of sand?!?! How about listening to the sound of 
    100 neurons clapping?!?!?! Or maybe looking at a bridge over troubled 
    neurons!?!?!? Before you think I'm on drugs or something, I should explain 
    here that I'm actually talking about the various things mentioned by 
    this really spiffy science article about really small circuits!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.omnimag.com/live_science/circuit/">http://www.omnimag.com/live_science/circuit/</a> </p>
