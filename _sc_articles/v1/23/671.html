<p>That Jon Katz 
    person certainly knows how to get people annoyed!!!!! One of his recent 
    columns on Slashdot tangled with the throny issue of articifical intelligence, 
    and whether it's possible soon or not... Katz argued it was!!!!!!!! 
    Just add more fuel to the fire, he argued it in the middle of a book 
    review by some bloke, who had also argued in favour of artificial intelligence 
    soon-ish, but had done so in such a way as to hype up his own consulting 
    agency!!!!!!!! </p><p> The comments following it were even more enjoyable!!!!!!!! They 
    started off with the usual "Woah!!! Kewl!!! Hook me up, man!!!" type 
    comments, then the "Oh, it'll never happen!!!!!!!!" type guff took 
    over!!!!!!!! At which point things degenerated to the point where 
    people were arguing about the Turing Test, (Where you have a conversation 
    with someone over a text console linkup, and you've to determine on 
    that basis alone whether or not you've been talking with a computer 
    or a real person!!!!!) with the usual "But, even if they do pass the 
    Turing Test, computers don't have any soul, man!!!" type arguments 
    (Which is completely irrelevant to the Turing Test anyway!!!!!!), 
    and there was even a spot of Evolution vs Creationism arguments!!!!!! 
    All in all, the most hilarious load of comments we've ever seen, since 
    we looked at ITV Teletext Viewer Letters on p327 yesterday, anyway!!!!!!!! </p><p> <a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/books/99/01/18/198243.shtml">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/books/99/01/18/198243.shtml</a>
<p> But Katz and co. may soon have the last laugh!!!!! Apparently some 
    clever scientest people have perfected a "dynamics-based computation" 
    technique that uses chaotic elements to "evolve" answers!!!!! This 
    is apprently a new alternative to the usual digital computing methods, 
    and apparently <i>"may be well suited for optical computing using 
    ultra-fast chaotic lasers and computing with silicon/neural tissue 
    hybrid circuitry"</i>!!!!!!!! </p>
<p> Argh!!! "Silicon/neural tissue hybrid"?!?!?! Isn't that what the 
    Borg are made of, or something?!?!?!?!? I wouldn't like to be assimilated 
    by a dynamics-based computer whilst trying to get it to "evolve" an 
    answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
