<p>Now, you'll probably be watching this latest series of "<b>Red Dwarf</b>" on
    your little tellyboxes, but did you know that in future when you see "Holly" on
    tha screen, you'll be able to see every crevasse on his baldy head- in 3D!!!!
    That's because finally someone's actually worked out how to do 3D telly
    without those little glasses with bits of cellophane or Polaroid film in
    them!!!!!!!!!! And even better, it's done using hologrammes!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Now, before you think I've been reading one of those old sci-fi magazines, I
    have to tell you that this time someone's actually made it work!!!!!
    Apparently all you need is a backlit LCD screen, and a special holographic
    pattern!!!!!!! This pattern splits the image on the LCD screen into two images
    which travel to each eye seperately, just like with a static hologramme!!!!!
    So, you can send two perspected 3D images to the screen- and you'll see the 3D
    effect!!!!!!!!</p><p>As with a static hologramme, you generally have to be in front of the telly to
    get the 3D effect, but then if you're watching "Red Dwarf" from the flippin'
    kitchen, then I wouldn't exactly think that you're too interested in the 3D
    effects!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It'll be quite amusing tho to watch Rimmer say
    he's a "hard light" hologramme- when we're watching him as a "soft light"
    hologramme!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990206/newsstory5.html">http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990206/newsstory5.html</a></p>
