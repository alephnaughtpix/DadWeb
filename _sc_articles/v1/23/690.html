<p>Well, as they say, size is important!!!!!!!!!!!! Especially if you've got 20
    inches, like I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about the size of my
    television screen!!!!!!!!!! But in future I might be feeling a little
    inadequate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because Pioneer are now making *<b>50
    inch</b>* plasma-based telly screens!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/features/9902-Plasma1.asp">http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/features/9902-Plasma1.asp</a></p>
