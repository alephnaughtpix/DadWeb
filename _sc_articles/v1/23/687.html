<p>Some of you young 
    sprites might dimly remember that at the end of last year the <b>Senior 
    Dads</b> multimedia empire expanded a little bit!!!!!!!!!!! We are of 
    course talking about our brillibobs all-music-and-no-talk internet radio 
    station, <b>Radio East Milton</b>!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="18.html#541"> 
    issue 18</a>...) Now, some of you might be saying: "Well, your playlist 
    of stuff like Abba, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, The Beach Boys, Public Enemy 
    and Bow Wow Wow is really wicked, man, but when are you lot going to 
    do your own flippin' radio progs?!?!?!" The answer is- we don't have 
    time to do a whole flippin' live radio station, you idiots!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p>But these are pretty exciting days for internet radio fans!!!!!!!! Not only
    are there big libraries of music like <b>Imagine Radio</b>, (Who do our radio
    station!!!!!) there was also recently Nullsoft's spiffy <b>Shoutcast</b>,
    which allowed anything that could be played on Winamp to be broadcast on tha
    NetWeb like it was a RealAudio server!!!!!!! Now here's a new one- and it's a
    "talkie" equivalent of Imagine Radio!!!!!!! And it allows you to add your own
    programmes!!!!!! This spiffy lot are called <b>Radio Orang</b> for some
    reason, and they've got heaps of programmes and various bits contributed by
    outside people!!!!! You can stitch all these bits together in your own
    playlist, and publish that playlist!!!!!!!!!! So, who knows!!!! Maybe, we'll
    be able to stich together our own playlist, add a couple of our own bits, and
    bring out <b>Radio West Milton</b>!!!!!!!!!!!! Not that we're promising
    anything of course!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17668.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17668.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
