<p>Well, it might 
    be a few months away from us, but we're already gearing up for it!!!!!! 
    No, we're not talking about Xmas!!!!!!! We're really talking about the 
    new Star Wars film!!!!!! They've already started the posters for it!!!!! 
    Notice tho- the film is supposed to be called "Star Wars: The Phantom 
    Menace", but look here- it's called "Episode 1" in the poster!!! Erm....</p><p><a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/1998/46/one_sheet.html">http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/1998/46/one_sheet.html</a></p>
