<p>When I saw the headline "<b>Why Hooters Carries DirecTV</b>" in this interesting little 
    article, I thought that these "Hooters" must be really big then!!!!!! 
    But it was all a misunderstanding!!!!!!! In fact, it's to do with a 
    restaurant chain that have a TV system with 500 channels!!!!!!!! So 
    now you can pick Playboy TV, and see hooters- in Hooters!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17439.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17439.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
