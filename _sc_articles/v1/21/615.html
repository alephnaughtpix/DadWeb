<p>Talking of MP3.com, you might remember that some time ago we mentioned one of their stranger 
    artists, some dude called <b>Chuckie Dogg Fresh</b>, who talked an awful 
    lot about "bitches" and "mo fo" people on his album "The Shit Is Wack"!!!!! 
    (See <a href="14.html#426"> issue 14</a>...) Well, we've seen his page 
    on mp3.com again recently, and there's been a couple of changes!!!! 
    For a start, the album has been renamed "This Shit *<b>Be</b>* Wack", 
    and for another, the Dogg's piccy has gone!!!! Presumably this is because 
    the "Dogg" feels that he'll get less of a slagging off from "homies" 
    who think he is a tad patronising if he doesn't put up any pic of himself!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Well, he's now got an alter-ego in the reggae section, called
    <b>Chuck Rastaboyee Fresh</b>!!!!! And in his "Nicely Stylin'", he's
    still got his original "Dogg" piccy up there!!!! As he says in his
    page: "Yum yum ladies gimme sum"!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/music/Reggae/6122.html">http://www.mp3.com/music/Reggae/6122.html</a></p><p>However, in case a few people start slagging him off there as well,
    and he decides to remove his pic there, here's our local copy!!!!</p>

    <p>Bet you can imagine him going: <i>"Everybody in the house throw
    yo hands up in tha air!!!! And wave them around like you just
    don't care!!!!!!!!!"</i></p>
