<p>If you've got lots of awesome realtime graphics computing power, how would
    you use it to imporve your football coverage?!?!?!? Well, according to
    this telly channel in the US, you would use all those computers to draw a
    little line on the pitch!!!!!!!!!! Yes, this lot are using loads of technology
    in order to seemlessly draw a "ten yard line" on shots of an American football
    pitch, in real-time during a match!!!!!!!!! Maybe in future, we could have
    computer enhanced TV coverage of football matches over here... Though if
    it was Partick Thistle playing, it would probably need more enhancement than
    current computing power can provide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/17192.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/17192.html</a></p>
