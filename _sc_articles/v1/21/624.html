<p>But in the future, major labels might be using this instead!!!!!! Some
    bloke, who looks like something out of a mid 1970s Open University program,
    has knocked up this computer thingy, which makes up music in any style!!!!!
    So a future equivalent of <b>Steps</b> or Boyzone won't need to keep doing
    cover versions of other people's well-known songs!!!!!!!! But they probably
    will still use them anyway!!!!! Because they're rubbish!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_240000/240642.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_240000/240642.stm</a></p>
