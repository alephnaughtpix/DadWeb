<p>Someone at that NT course I'm on discovered this trick on tha web!!!!!!
    It's a very neat card trick- and it uses no sneaky stuff like CGI or
    Java/Javascript!!!!!! So how is it done?!?!?! Well, have a go yourself,
    and see if you can work it out.... After a little examination and testing,
    we found out how it worked, and we were kicking ourselves!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www3.mcps.k12.md.us/users/rsfay/magic/">http://www3.mcps.k12.md.us/users/rsfay/magic/</a></p>
