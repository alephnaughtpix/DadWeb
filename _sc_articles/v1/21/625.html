<p>Well, you might have heard of the VHS of new video media, <b>DVD</b>, but
    you might not have yet heard of the Blockbusters/Sky Box Office of new video
    media, called <b>DIVX</b>!!!!! Unlike DVD, DIVX "software" only allows you
    to play it for a limited amount of time, then you have to pay to view it
    again!!!!!</p><p>For some odd reason, a lot of people don't really like this idea!!!!! And
    there's been a lot of DVD/DIVX flamewars going on, and a lot of the pro-DVD
    websites are not too kind about DIVX!!!!!! One thing there hasn't been
    too much of though, is websites that are actually in _<i>favour</i>_ of
    DIVX- until recently, when a few of them suddenly sprang up from
    nowhere!!!!! Oddly enough, a few people on the DVD side wondered if
    the sites were actually made up by pro DIVX companies!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19981220S0001">http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19981220S0001</a></p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16889.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/16889.html?wnpg=all</a></p><p>Then, guess what happened!!!!!!!!!! After the Wired story, the site Prodivx.com suddenly mysteriously went down!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16923.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16923.html</a></p>
