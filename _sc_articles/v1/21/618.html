<p>You wouldn't belive how many people have been asking me: <i>"Old Fart,
    being the really 'hip' dude that you are, are you going to be getting
    one of those new-fangled <b>Rio</b> MP3 Walkman thinges?!?!?!</i>"!!!!! To
    which I say: <i>"Get out of my way, you young whippersnappers!!!!!"</i>!!!!!
    Erm, yes well anyway, here is a little article about the whole load of
    Rio-style MP3 players that are coming in from South Korea, which looks to
    dominate the MP3 Walkman market at the moment!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/kh1230/m1230b12.html">http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/kh1230/m1230b12.html</a></p>
