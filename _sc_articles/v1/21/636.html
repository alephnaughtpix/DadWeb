<p>Now I bet you thought a <b>Jabber</b> was what young people called a
    hypodermic syringe!!!!!!!! Well, you'd be wrong!!!!!!!! It's actually
    a Linux messaging system, bit like ICQ, and that bloody annoying Netscape AOL
    Instant Messenger proggy that starts up when I use the internet!!!!! (And
    I can't flippin' get rid of it either!!!!!!! It's even worse than those
    bloody disks they stick in every computing magazine!!!!!! It really gets
    up my nose!!!!!!!!!) Erm, anyway!!! It's like those two progs, but it's
    compatible with both of them!!!!! It also uses that spiffy XML business-
    and it's open source!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://jabber.org/">http://jabber.org/</a></p>
