<p>Now this is interesting!!!!!! If you're having problems with working
    your video recorder, (Like forgetting where the record button is, or
    what channel to switch to!!!!) then you might like this!!!!
    <b>ReplayTV</b> is a spiffy little "short-term" video recorder that
    is able to work by itself!!!!!! That's because it uses loads of
    computer stuff, and it doesn't record on a video tape- it record
    programs on a hard drive!!!!!!!!! (That's why it's "short-term",
    presumably!!!!!!!!!) It also connects with the Replay site on tha
    inphopipe highweb, to find out when programs are, so you can record
    a proggy, and then say to the videobox thingy to record all future
    episodes... And it'll get the details from the Replay site, and
    record them!!!! You can even get it to search for unknown programs
    of a specific genere (eg sci-fi, cop drama, thrash metal, etc.), and
    it'll find them and record it for you, so you can have your own
    special "Old Fart" telly channel!!!!</p><p>How long before this sortof thing blurs with the Internet, and we have a telly equivalent of
    <b>Imagine Radio</b> or <b>Shoutcast</b> on tha netweb?!?!?!
    Personally I can't wait till we can launch <b>East Milton Gold</b>,
    <b>East Milton Movies</b>, <b>East Milton Gardening</b>, and so on!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.replaytv.com/faq.html">http://www.replaytv.com/faq.html</a></p>
