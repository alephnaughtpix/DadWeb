<p>Here's another thing you might remember about the early 80s!!!!!! The BBC
    Micro we all know and love was launched as part of the <b>Beeb's Computer
    Literacy Programme</b>, another part of which was this telly proggy called
    "<b>The Computer Programme</b>"!!!!! (Funky name, huh?!?!?) The title
    sequence had some owl flying about whilst "Computer World" by those Kraftwerk
    dudes played in the background!!!!!</p><p>You might remember that, but do you remember the very first bit in the
    very first ever programme, just before the titles ran?!?!?! Well, I do!!!!
    It was this sort of "comedy sketch" thing, with Roy Kinnear as the bloke
    who ran a computer shop, and Fred Harris (From that classic telly show,
    "Leapfrog"!!!) as a really naive person wanting to buy a computer!!!! At one
    point, Fred wondered what colours the computers were available in, and we
    all rolled in the isles (Laughing!!!!) because we knew that you couldn't
    get computers in different colours!!!!!!!</p><p>Well, Fred has the last laugh now!!!! Apple are now releasing their iMacs
    in five different colours!!!!!!! So now someone who knows nothing about
    computers can now walk into a computer shop, ask for a computer in green,
    and we won't be able to laugh at them any more!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17173.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/17173.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
