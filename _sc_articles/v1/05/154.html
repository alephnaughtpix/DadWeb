<p>Well, it's news to me!!!! Apparently last month (July) was the
    hottest ever the world over since records began!!! Not in Scotland
    it wasn't!!!! But then that might be because the increased global
    temperatures are starting to melt more ice at the poles, and are
    contributing to a move in the Gulf Stream, which usually brings all
    the mild weather to Britain, and thus global warning might make for
    colder weather in the UK!!! Or so said some TV prog I saw recently...</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/086327.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/086327.htm</a></p>
