<p>Remember Orville singing <i>"I wish I could fly, way up to the sky, but I can't!!!"</i>.
    Well, even if that daft bird can't get over his confidence problem (And who can blame him-
    after all he's got green feathers!!!!!), he can still wish that he could fly, way up to the sky,
    and he CAN!!!!- with the help of the "first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen"!!!! Yes, Moller International
    (Don't they do those funny yoghurt and rice thingies with little bits of jam in them?!?!) have
    come up with this thingy called the M400, which is apparently better than cars and stuff!! "No
    matter how you look at it the automobile is only an interim step on our evolutionary path to
    independence from gravity." they say!!! I think the driving test for this vehicle would be a
    bit harder tho!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.moller.com/skycar.htm">http://www.moller.com/skycar.htm</a></p>
