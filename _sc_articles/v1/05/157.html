<p>When you're wanting to register a domain name, what if someone's
    already used it?!!? You might find yourself getting sued by
    someone on the other side of the world because you're using one
    of their trademarks!!! So some company has decided to make money
    off you by making sure that this doesn't happen!!!! You can search for
    the domain name you want and see if you clashes with any trademarks!!!
    So far, no-one's taken seniordads.* !!! (Don't get any ideas tho!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.namestake.com/">http://www.namestake.com/</a></p>
