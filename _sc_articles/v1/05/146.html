    with the Atari diskmag <b>Maggie</b>. I was on IRC on
    Sunday night (9/8/98) and here's how the conversation went...</p><pre class="usenet">&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: did u watch anything of VH-1 at all today ?
&lt;OldFart&gt; feL: Nope- anything interesting?!?!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: yep, they visited the Senior Dads website and
showed off the <a href="../../../demos/airdirt.html">Air-Dirt demo</a> ;)
&lt;OldFart&gt; fel: !!!!!! What!!!!!!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: at about 2.30 pm, they did a 
'random' search of the web and came
up with your site ;)
&lt;OldFart&gt; Fel: Woo!!! Got a video of it?!??!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: unfortunately not - if I
had seen it here I would have taped it
for you. I was over at a barbecue at that
time today ;(
* OldFart looks for VH-1 webpages....</pre><p>Well, I've emailed VH-1 to check.... And so far have had no reply!!!</p><p><i>(If anyone has a tape of VH-1 on Sun Aug 9 between 1400-1500 - I
    think it might have been the "Clare Grogan Show" - could you please
    mail us at <a href="mailto://senior@forfree.at">mailto://senior@forfree.at</a> !!!)</i></p><p>Meanwhile, if you have an Atari Falcon, you have a look at the
