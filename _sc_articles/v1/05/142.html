<p>Well, that was quick!!!! No point in downloading "Back Orifice" (See <a href="4.html#111">issue 4</a>...)
    now, as ISS X-Force have worked out how to detect it and stop it!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.iss.net/xforce/alerts/advise5.html">http://www.iss.net/xforce/alerts/advise5.html</a></p><p>Or have they? Cult of the Dead Cow, the really "groovily" named
    dudes behind the Back Orifice program have now released a Unix
    version, complete with the usual full sourcecode!!! Hmm, I
    wonder if we're now going to get customised versions appearing
    all over the place?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/tools/">http://www.cultdeadcow.com/tools/</a></p>
