<p>Virtual aquariums!!!!! That's the latest craze in US software apparently
    and Mindscape's Aquazone Deluxe is the piece of software we've got
    to blame!! The link below is to an article about some kid who's
    apparently as obsessed with her virtual aquarium as some people have
    been obssesed with their Tamagotchis!! (Or is that "Tamagotchix"?!? Or
    "Tamagotchii"!??! Or... Ah, who cares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.ohio.com/bj/business/netrider/docs/001525.htm">http://www.ohio.com/bj/business/netrider/docs/001525.htm</a></p>
