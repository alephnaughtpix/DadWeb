<p>Talking of "2 to the power of n" type numbers, this machine from SGI has got
    2048 procesors in it!!! They says something about a "25%
    increase in bandwidth", but I would have thought that it
    would have been 32% because 32 = 2 to the power of 5 !!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/all/9808123cray">http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/all/9808123cray</a></p>
