<p>First, Hasbro bought Atari, a company that made a computer called the Falcon...
    Now they've bought Microprose, a software company that made a game called
    Falcon!!! Seeing as they appear to really like Falcons, I wonder if they'll
    try to buy Scotland next?!?! There's a lot of Falcons there you know!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/14382.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/14382.html</a></p>
