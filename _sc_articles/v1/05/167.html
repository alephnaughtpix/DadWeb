<p>Well, I think it's a nice write-up, but I'm not entirely sure because their
    review of <b><a href="../../../demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a></b>
    uses a lot of big words!!! Get issue 26 of the diskmag anyway, because it's
    really very good!!! It works on Atari computers, but you can also run the ST
    edition on a PC under the <b>Pacifist</b> emulator!!!</p><p>Here's a nice little review of it on <b>Network</b>, which contains a
    link to downloads of the issue:</p><p><a href="http://scene-central.com/magreviews/atari/show.html?id_magreview=42">http://scene-central.com/magreviews/atari/show.html?id_magreview=42</a></p>
