<p>Have you got a website that looks really crap?!?!?! Why not get it
    entered for a "Muddy"!?!?! This is apparently some of sort award
    thingy for really crappy websites!!! Apparently if you win you actually
    get an award presented to you at some ceremony in San Fransisco in the
    autumn!!! So get cracking everybody, and look for really crappy websites
    in places far away from the West coast of the US, like Poland or
    New Zealand or somewhere!!! (Hee hee!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.netstudio.com/muddies/">http://www.netstudio.com/muddies/</a></p>
