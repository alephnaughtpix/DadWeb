<p>You want small proggies!?!? Well, this lot will give it you!! The Hughi small
    proggy compy (Aren't the first 2 words contradictory?!?!) is a compy to make
    a pong game as small as possible!!! Hmmm, sounds a bit like those 128 byte
    demos we had in the Atari scene at the beginning of this year, doesn't it?!?!?
    In fact, one of them was a pong game!!!!! Well, the PC dudes haven't got down
    to 128 bytes yet!!!! So, all you Atari people, go and show 'em!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/6062/compo.htm">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/6062/compo.htm</a></p><p>If you have an Atari Falcon, get No-Crew's 128 byte Pong Game here:</p><p><a href="ftp://ftp.nocrew.org/pub/nocrew/demos/128bytes/pong.lzh">ftp://ftp.nocrew.org/pub/nocrew/demos/128bytes/pong.lzh</a></p><p>Oh yea!!!
