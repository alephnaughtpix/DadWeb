<p>Of a very low intensity though!!! Dr Gerard Hyland of Warwick Uni has found
    that your body's electromagnetic field might give off the odd photon, and
    this isn't actually a random thing, it's actually part of your body's
    natural functions!!! This might open a can worms, as this means that
    things which give off low electromagnetic fields (eg the microwaves
    from mobile phones and microwave ovens!!) might be actually interfering
    directly with your body's electromagnetic field!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/news/pr/97">http://www.warwick.ac.uk/news/pr/97</a></p>
