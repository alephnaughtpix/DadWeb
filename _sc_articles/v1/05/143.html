<p>As we mentioned before (See <a href="4.html#121">issue 4</a>...), sometimes some people
    don't quite see the funny side of email exchanges where people
    threaten violent death in a jovial friendly sense!!!!! The latest
    apparent victim of this is a bloke living in Estonia called Martin
    Symons, who made some joke about someone being killed!!! Unfortunately
    the Estonian authorities didn't really see the funny side of it!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_146000/146432.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_146000/146432.stm</a></p>
