<p><b>Magenetars!!!</b> Sounds like something that you would get in
    the Transformers cartoon!!!! But it isn't!!!!! It's a dead start with a really
    really powerful magnetic field!!!!! Apparently a magnetar has a crusty
    top as well!! And it occasionally breaks about in a rather big earthquake!!!!
    Just as well San Fransisco isn't on a magnetar, or it would have had a
    slighlty less mild earthquake this week!!!

    commerical domain name!!!!!)</p>
