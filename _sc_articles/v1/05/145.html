<p>Remember in Uni when you got a student email addr that was made up
    from your name and matric no and it was completely unreadable and
    really hard to remember?!?!? Well, that's what President Clinton

    every US citizen an email addr!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9808/07/postal.idg/">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9808/07/postal.idg/</a></p>
