<p>When Prove It 2000, a piece of software used to check other software
    for the millenium bug, was run on Windows 98, it said that 98 might
    suffer from a millenium prob!!!! Then the makers of Prove It 2000
    checked more carefully, and found it didn't suffer from the
    end-of-millenium bug!!!! It suffered from an end-of-every-year bug!!! Apparently
    Windows 98 leaps two days forward or one day back when the clock
    ticks past midnight on Hogmanay (or New Year's Eve for non-Scottish
    readers!!!), for every year they tested!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_148000/148556.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_148000/148556.stm</a></p>
