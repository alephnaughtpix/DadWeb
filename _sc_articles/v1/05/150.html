<p>Well, looks like DVD is probably going to take off after all!!!! And
    the best sign is the announcement from Twentieth Century Fox Home
    Entertainment that they're going to release some titles on DVD!!! But
    the dead giveaway is the absolutely dire choice of titles- just like
    the early days of home video!!! Check this out: Porky's, Predator,
    Jingle All The Way, Marked For Death, Home Alone 3, and Hope Floats!!!
    The only decent titles in the whole bunch are The Abyss and Young
    Frankenstien!!! I suppose we'll just have to brave cheapo
    straight-to-DVD crap with the odd occasional gem for a few more years
    just like we did with videos!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980810/ca_20th_ce_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980810/ca_20th_ce_1.html</a></p>
