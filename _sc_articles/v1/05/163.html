<p>Both of them!!!! Just before our review of the debut issue hit tha web!!! 
    (See <a href="4.html#112">issue 4</a>...) The <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> 
    domain name suddenly disappeared and the page on the Gamerush site giving a contact for 
    subscription to the ezine likewise went el disappearo!!! Surely our review wasn't that bad!!! 
    We've emailed them to find out what the four fruit marmalade is going on... Any news, you'll 
    read it here!!! Well, not here literally, but in some future issue... (Possibly!!)</p>
