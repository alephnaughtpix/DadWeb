<p>Sony thought they were onto a winner when they did a camera that could
    shoot in night-vision!!! Unfortunely when this "feature" is used in daylight,
    the "night-vision" works out a bit more like Superman's X-ray vision- on people
    that is!! So an average shot of a nice family day in the park shot through this
    camera will end up looking like a rather blurry old pic of a nudist colony!!!!
    </p><p>For some extraordinary reason, Sony have recalled this wonder of modern
    technology!!! Shame on them I say- not that I'm a peeping tom or anything...</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14379.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14379.html</a></p>
