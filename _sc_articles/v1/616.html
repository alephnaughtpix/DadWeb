<p>As you might have noticed from the Slashdot link above, those clever
    peeps at Slashdot-land have noticed that their server is getting so popular
    these days, that at some times it's very hard to get on!!!!! So they've
    started up another server called <b>Cachedot</b>, which keeps a copy of
    all the articles in Slashdot, so if you can't get in Slashdot proper,
    then you can still see the latest news here!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/</a></p>
