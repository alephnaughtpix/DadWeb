<p>But not just any sandwich- a DVD sandwich!!! No, this not some strange
    nouvelle cuisine as you might think!!!! It's actually a way to solve the
    problem of the length of storage in DVD disks!!! At the moment the DVD
    disks haven't been long enough on either side for a full movie, and so
    halfway through, you would have to flip over to the other side of the disk,
    just like on a gramaphone!!!!! But now they've worked out how to "sandwich"
    two sides onto the same side, and they apparently have increased the length
    on the single side to 6 hours!!!! (Yes, I know that makes it sound as though
    one normal DVD side has 3 hours and so is long enough for most movies-
    don't ask me why!!!!!!) </p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19980923/newscien/906508860-1141407790.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19980923/newscien/906508860-1141407790.html</a></p>
