<p>Yes, someone's worked out how to interface between the CGI thingy on a
    webserver and the Javascript on your browsey-wowsey in order to work out
    what's in your cache, and where you've been on tha W3!!!!! Only one prob-
    that sort of data is not supposed to go beyond your browsey-wowsey, so it's
    a bit of security prob!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15285.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15285.html</a></p>
