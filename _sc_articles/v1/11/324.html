<p>Have you ever been in the car driving down the road and thought: <i>"Oh
    I'm bored looking at this road, I wish I could watch Countdown instead!!!!
    But I can't watch TV in the car beacuse the metal frame in conjunction
    with interference generated by the engine jams any TV signals coming
    in!!!!!"</i> Well, don't worry, now thanks to the miracle of digital TV
    some bods have worked out how to correct for the interference, and
    now you can watch TV in a car!!!! It'll certainly be an interesting
    experience to watch <b>"Police! Stop!"</b> on TV whilst you're driving
    down the motorway at 100 miles an hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19980929/newscien/907027260-3557613570.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19980929/newscien/907027260-3557613570.html</a></p>
