<p>Are you recovering from last month's gamma ray exposure!?!?!?! (ooh-er!!!)
    Well, you should be affected, as a star from a quite a few light years away
    threw out a gigantic gamma ray pulse, which affected 7 satellites in orbit
    around the Earth, shutting down 2 of them for a short time!!! It even <i>"it
    knocked electrons out of the atoms in Earth's upper atmosphere"</i> !!!!!! Apparently
    the culprit is this star is called <b>Aquila</b>, which is something called
    a "magnetar", which ... er, doesn't this sound familiar!??!?! Oh yeah, we've
    mentioned magnetars before!!! (See <a href="5.html#166">issue 5</a>...) And
    in the story referenced, Aquila got a mention!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/012819.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/012819.htm</a></p>
