<p>You might remember <b>Robbie the robot</b> in the file <b>"Forbidden
    Planet"</b> being delayed because he needed an "oil change"!!!! Well, if the
    film was made today, he would be delayed because he needed to reboot
    Windows!!!!! This is because there are now apparently a new generation of
    robots controlled by PCs!!!!!!!! They can do things like <i>"serve you
    drinks, set a VCR, even vacuum your apartment. "</i> I don't know if I like
    the last idea tho!!! I mean, if a robot was to race all round the house
    with my Dyson, whilst still connected to the PC, it would cause a lot of
    damage!!!!!!!!!!
  <p>It's not all housework tho... <i>"One dentist in St. Clair Shores, Michigan
    uses robots to talk to children when they arrive for dental work. "</i> Just
    as well they didn't use real people- that would just be too sinister!!!!!!!</p>
