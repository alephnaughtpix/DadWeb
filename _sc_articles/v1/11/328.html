<p>A lot of people were a little cheesed off earlier this year when some dude
    called Fraunhofer put a patent on an algorithm to encode MP3 files!!!! Well,
    some Swedish dude has found out the patent doesn't really apply in his own
    country, and has gone right ahead and done an encoder using the "Fraunhofer"
    algorithm!!!!!!!! And he's even done it for all you Linux dudes!!!</p><p><a href="http://bladeenc.home.ml.org/">http://bladeenc.home.ml.org/</a></p><p>Here's that naughty Fraunhofer dude...</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/095.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/095.html</a></p>
