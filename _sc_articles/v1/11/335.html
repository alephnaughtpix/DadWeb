<p>Whenever in the future, in that spiffy digital telly era or whatever, you see
    some "famous" person wearing "shades" whilst walking past the "papparazzi",
    who then trips up and falls into a plant pot, what are you likely to say!??!
    Well, you'll probably say: "Oh, he's checking up on his share options"!!!!!!
    The reason you'll be saying this is because "shades" in the future will
    not really be shades!!!! Sony had just developed LCD Screens which can be
    put in "shades"!! So you'll be able to check up on the latest news, whilst
    you're tripping over everyone!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/118890.html">http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/118890.html</a></p>
