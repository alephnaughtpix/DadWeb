<p>How about give you lead poisoning!?!?!?! There's been quite a few necklaces
    sold in the US with the words "What would Jesus do" on them!!!! Unfortunately
    they're made of lead, and not properly sealed up and can cause to lead
    poisoning!!!!! So for loads of people their fervent belief in the Son of God
    has cost them quite a few cells in the brain department!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/074678.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/074678.htm</a></p>
