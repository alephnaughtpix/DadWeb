<p>Have you ever looked at a printed circuit board and thought: "Hmmm!!!
    I wonder what this would look like if there were a big hairy spider
    crawling all over it?!?!?!?"?!?!?!?!? Well, now you can find out!!!!
    Because in this government webpage, they've got pictures... Of
    spiders crawling over silicon chips!!!!!!! Why, I do not know, but
    there must be an interesting reason for it or something!!!!! Perhaps
    the government wants to make sure that their machine will still work,
    even if big hairy spiders crawl all over them!!!!!!!!!!
