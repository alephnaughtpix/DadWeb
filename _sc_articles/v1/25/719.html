<p>We'll probably need to get orange oblong "media" glasses and adopt an "ironic" grin 
    now!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently MTV bought our radio station <b>Radio East 
    Milton</b> (See <a href="18.html#541"> issue 18</a>...) last week, and 
    we didn't notice!!!!!!!!! That's because they've bought over the company 
    <b>Imagine Radio</b> who do our internet radio station!!!!!!!! Apparently 
    this buyout is part of MTV's "Buggles Project", which is a bit ironic 
    as the song The Buggles are most famous for is <i>"Video Killed the 
    Radio Star"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/053764.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/<br/>
