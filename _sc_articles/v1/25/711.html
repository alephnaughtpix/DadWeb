<p>I bet when you 
    were doing all those funny shapes in Lego (And then actually building 
    something with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) when you were young, that you weren't 
    thinking: <i>"Hmmm... Wouldn't it be really great if I could write an 
    operating system for this!??!?!?!"</i> Well, OK, you might have done, 
    but if did, you're a bit slow!!!!!!! Because it's only now that someone 
    has done has actually done it!!!!!!! Yes, it's a special Linux program 
    for people who wish to connect their computes to that funny <b>Mindstorms</b> 
    range of bricks that those tight-fisted peeps in Lego-land didn't send 
    us a beta test copy of!!!!!!! (See <a href="2.html#45"> issue 2</a>...) 
    BTW it's called... <b>LegOS</b>!!!!!!!! I hope it doesn't get confused 
    with any operating systems for artificial legs!!!!!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/18065.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/<br/>
