<p>Have you ever  driven a car, crashed it, and then subsequently thought: <i>"Wouldn't 
    it be a great idea if I was ever in that precarious situation again, 
    that a disembodied presence would take over from me and drive to safety!?!?!?!"?!?</i> 
    Well, some clever people are working on it!!! However, unlike co-pilots 
    in airlines, this co-pilot won't have to keep fiddling with his joystick!!!!!!! 
    That's because it's actually a computer which can control the steering 
    and speed, and take over at the first sign of danger!!!!!!!!!! So you'll 
    probably always find yourself slowing down behind Skodas!!!!!!!!! And 
    the really funny thing is, it's by the <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>, 
    those nice people who patent their MP3 encoding algorhythms!!!!!!!!!! 
    (See <a href="11.html#328"> issue 11</a>...) You'll probably need to 
    install one of those funny new MP3 players in your car to get this thing 
    to work!!!!!!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19990222/newscien/919641660-2415951901.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19990222/<br/>
