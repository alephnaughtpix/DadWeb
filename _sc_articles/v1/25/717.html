<p>If you've ever 
    been to one of those <b>Newstrolls</b> (See <a href="6.html#192"> issue 
    6</a>...) links, you might know exactly why the <b>New York Times</b> 
    website is so bloody irritating!!!!! yes, that's right, it's one of 
    those sites where you have to "register" with them before you can view 
    any of their news stories!!!!!!!! Even worse, they do it really well, 
    so it's not like the UK <b>Times</b> website where a user's registration 
    number is part of the URL, giving you a URL that you <i>can</i> read 
    a story from without registering, and then navigate through the rest 
    of the "restricted" site!!!!!!!! Well, here's one way you can get by 
    the NY Times' barriers!!!!!!!!!! The paper now does a news summary in 
    MP3 format from mp3.com!!!!!! But evn then, the NYT lot are still being 
    bloody irritating- there's no RealAudio "Instant Play" function, so 
    you have to download a flippin' meg and a half of MP3 before you can 
    listen to and decide if it's worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/audible/">http://www.mp3.com/audible/</a></p>
