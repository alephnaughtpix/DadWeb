<p>Shortly after 
    we told you about Microsoft patenting stylesheets, (See <a href="24.html#694"> 
    issue 24</a>...) we heard of this mind-boggling story of MS wanting 
    to buy into the Linux market!!!!!!!!!!!!! A couple of years ago, some 
    guy brought the domain name <b>linux.com</b>, and he's now selling it!!!!!!! 
    And guess who was one of the bidders!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,33186,00.html">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,33186,00.html</a></p><p>This might be a surprise to some people who read a completely different
    story from another MS spokesperson the very next day!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
    according to this person Linux has a 'weak value proposition'- which no doubt
    explains why MS were wanting to buy into it, doesn't it?!?!?!?!?!?!
