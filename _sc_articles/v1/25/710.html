<p>Well, you might have been riveted by <b>Belle &amp; Sebastian</b> winning a gong,
    or <b>Bjorn Ulvaeus</b> putting on a brave face after the worst pop bands in
    Britain made a complete pigs ear of his songs, but here's an awards
    ceremony that is probably a little less like a music industry piss-up!!!!!!
    And it's all thanks to MP3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yep, it's the <b>MP3
    Music Awards</b>!!!!!!! So if you have a groovy tune, MP3 it and put
    it on tha NetWeb, then give this lot the URL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I still
    dunno why all their webpages are big single images with text and
    everything tho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.noisebox.com/awards/">http://www.noisebox.com/awards/</a></p>
