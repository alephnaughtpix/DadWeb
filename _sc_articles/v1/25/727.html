<p>Now this is sad!!!!!!!!!! Apparently someone actually studied the
    mathematics of knots in ties!!!!!!!!!!! Now when I was working in the old
    days, (When you couldn't even get into a Turkish bath without wearing a
    tie!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I just did a Full Windsor on my tie, (And then I tied
    it!!!!!!!!!! Ha ha ha ha!!!!!! Only joking!!!!) but this lot have actually
    worked out the "perfect" tie knot, and proved it by mathematics!!!!!!!!!!!
    Oddly enough, this page is from a website in Cambridge University.....</p><p><a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/papers_html/tie1/paper/paper.html">http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/<br/>
