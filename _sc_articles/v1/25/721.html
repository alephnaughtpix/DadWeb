<p>Well, this is an intresting idea from the lot who do those sweetie
    thingies called <b>M&amp;Ms</b>!!!!!!!! You can order M&amp;Ms from their website- in
    custom colours!!!!!!!!!!!! So, if you've ever thought it would be a really
    good idea to get M&amp;Ms in "cyan" and "teal green", now's your chance!!!!!!!!
    Only one problem tho... You can only order a minium of 40 pounds worth!!!!!!!!
    That might not sound too much, but this is not a UK website, it's an
    American one!!!!!!!!! And when they say 40 pounds, they actually mean 40
    pounds- in weight!!!!!!! Which ends up more expensive than one of those
    flippin' Diamond Rio MP3 players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.m-ms.com/colorworks/picker2.html">http://www.m-ms.com/colorworks/picker2.html</a></p>
