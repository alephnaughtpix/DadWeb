<p>Have you ever been surfing on tha NetWeb, and thought: <i>"Hmmm... It's a shame I 
    don't have a Wurlitzer with me!!!!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!</i> Well, now someone 
    has solved that somewhat awkward predicament!!!!!!!!! If you've got 
    a speedy gonzales netweb connection and the latest version of Winamp, 
    that is!!!!!!!! Yes, that's right, it's one of those delightful <b>Shoutcast</b> 
    broadcasting sites, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</a>...) and 
    this one's a jukebox style one!!!!!!!! This one allows one to browse 
    through a list of tunes, and select from them which ones you want to 
    be queued on the server next!!!!!!!!! And there's actually quite a good 
    choice!!!!!!!!! Despite the really dreary choice that passes for "random" 
    choices when no-one's requesting anything, (You would probably like 
    it if you read that "Rolling Stone" magazine a lot!!!!) there's actually 
    a slightly better choice than you get in most pub jukeboxes!!!! So when 
    we found about this really neat site, the first thing we did we did 
    was to stop all the Counting Crows and similar nonsense and queue up 
    some good old Aqua and Duran Duran, which must have been a bit disconcerting 
    to the other two listeners at the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>It's probably a bit dodgy on the legal front to say the least, what with all those
    copyright files being streamed outwards, but we like the
    idea, and can imagine a legit equivalent of it going down
    really well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So you might as well get along to it before
    someone goes el-stamp-o on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
