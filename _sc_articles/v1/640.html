<p>Well, you're used 
    to the speed and reliability that only Windows can provide, but are 
    you ready for it on your toaster!?!??!?! No, I'm not talking about a 
    CD-Writer here, silly!!!!! I'm talking about the thing you make toast 
    on!!!!!!!! Yes, that's right, MS wants a "Start" button on your home 
    electrical appliances, with the introduction of their Universial Plug 
    'n' Play initiative!!!!!!! I just hope that my bread doesn't cause a 
    general protection fault on an MS Toaster tho!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2184517,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2184517,00.html</a></p><p>For some reason, the folks at Slashdot seem to find this incredibly funny!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/01/10/0220207&amp;pid=0&amp;threshold=-1">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/01/10/0220207&amp;pid=0&amp;threshold=-1</a></p>
