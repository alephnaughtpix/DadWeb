<p>Whilst you're 
    grooving to the latest episode of Teletubbies, let's not forget the 
    1970s, equivalent, Playschool!!!! To help you bring back the days of 
    "Big Ted" and "Hambel", here's a really Playschool-like "dialogue" from 
    the <b>Daily Yomiuri</b> about artificial intelligence!!!!! All you 
    need now is someone to do the "tinkly" bits on a piano!!!! </p><pre class="usenet">Susan: I've been thinking a lot about thinking lately.
[Piano goes tinkly-winkly!!!]
Cathy: What do you mean?
[Piano goes tinkle-winkle!!!]
Susan: I've been wondering what it means to be intelligent, 
and whether any of the computers we're building here in 
Silicon Valley will ever be as smart as you and I.
[Piano does happy chord!!!]</pre><p><a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/1208cu18.htm">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/1208cu18.htm</a></p>
