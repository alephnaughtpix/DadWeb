<p>Goodbye HTTP, hello HTTP-NG!! Yes, the "Next Generation" of webserver
    dynamics is here!! OK, I can see you're falling asleep already, but
    it means spiffy new things at the webuser end!!! Like, foreign
    language versions of your pages!!! (OK, you need to translate yourself,
    but the the web server can tell the difference!!) And some brilly transmission
    protocol called SMUX which speeds up stuff!!! Er, actually I dunno what
    I'm talking about here, but it sounds good anyway!!!!!!!!!!!
