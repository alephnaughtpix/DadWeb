<p>(Sorry!!!) Kentucky just passed a law which allows the clergy to pack a pistol
    (A gun, you dirty so-and-so!!!!) in church as long as they've got a
    concealed-weapons permit!!! Wow!!! The congregations must get pretty rowdy
    in Kentucky!!! Not all the church dudes are happy though. One said: "Jesus
    would puke." !!!!!!!!!! (Look, I don't make these quotes up you know!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/US/9807/16/briefs.pm/holy.heat.ap/index.html">http://cnn.com/US/9807/16/briefs.pm/holy.heat.ap/index.html</a></p>
