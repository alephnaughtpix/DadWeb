<p>If you've been reading US web news, you'll probably be flippin sick of
    hearing about "portals"!!!! If you don't know already (Don't worry,
    they'll be going on about it over here in the UK pretty soon!!!), portals
    are basically web-guides with big front pages with lots of subject intrest
    headings, which have lots of little sub-headings and so on... The best
    example I can think of is the front page of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a>
    Well, now that virtually every search engine and ISP in the US has a
    "portal", companies are now trying to pretend that they're not at all the
    same as everyone else!!! And first up is Lycos, who now deny that they're
    a portal- apparently the magic word is now "hub"!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,3441,2120572,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,3441,2120572,00.html</a></p>
