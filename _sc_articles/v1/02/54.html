<p>I've just seen the debut of "Smilin' Peter The Happiest Chicken" on
    UK Teletext p171 today (18/7/98) on the UK games videotext mag Digitiser!!
    It's not really very good is it?!?! I mean this "character" seems to be
    happy all the time about everything and uses loads of exclamation marks!!!!!!
    And what with the refererences to his arthritec limbs, he sounds like a right
    old fart!!!</p><p><a href="http://x2.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=358803827&amp;CONTEXT=900716982.1454964927&amp;hitnum=2">http://x2.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=358803827&amp;CONTEXT=900716982.1454964927&amp;hitnum=2</a></p>
