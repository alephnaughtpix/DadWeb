<p>There's been a few funny rumours about this one!!! There's rumours going
    on about a film based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!!! Yes, I know
    there's already one form the 70s, but that was rubbish! :) Apparently it's
    from Warners, and the original rumours spoke of a live version with
    Michael Jackson in it!!! But apparently it's actually going to be a big
    cartoon. In the link below, apparently the film will be a bit "darker"
    than the older film, which probably means that it's a bit more like the
    original Roald Dahl book!!</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/news/980716/7.html">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/news/980716/7.html</a></p>
