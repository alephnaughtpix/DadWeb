<p>Well, we might be having all this nice Social Chapter protections and
    stuff here in Europe, but in the US... "Microsoft advocates enactment of a tax bill by October which would permit any
    employer to deprive any full-time, permanent employee of any employee benefit,
    according to David Stobaugh" Who this guy?!??! Well, he successfully
    fought a lawsuit on behalf of some MS full-time employees who didn't
    get treated as proper full-timers because they were put on the temp
    staff roll!! So MS is apparently trying to make their policy the law,
    so they can't get done!!!! Is this the first time MS have tried to
    "embrace and extend" the law?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.gagames.com/news/bits/6+9+98/16:36:12.html">http://www.gagames.com/news/bits/6+9+98/16:36:12.html</a></p>
