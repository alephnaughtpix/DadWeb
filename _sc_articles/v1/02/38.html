<p>Like "Killer Net" said, you can get loads of pictures of people "doing
    it" on the web!!! And here's a website where people will "do it" for
    the first time!!!! Yep, "Diane" and "Mike" are going to be the people
    "doing it"!!! It's not a porn thing tho!!!!! "We're going to do this
    as tastefully as possible" the organisers say... But as the "Netly News" says,
    it's got the following keywords in it's meta tags: "sex, teen, virgin,
    virginity, obscene, taboo, Live, student, condom, condomania, safe,
    deviant, purient, nude, minister, church, voyeur, forbidden, tasteless,
    gross, naked." !!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13716.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13716.html</a></p><p><a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/0,2326,201980715-14037,00.html">http://cgi.pathfinder.com/netly/0,2326,201980715-14037,00.html</a></p>
