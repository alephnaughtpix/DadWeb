<p>Don't worry, I wasn't having a heart attack there!!!!!!! It's actually
    German!!!! It's actually an interactive "Musical Dice Game" done by
    Mozart in the olden days!!! Apparently you rolled the dice a few times,
    and a beautiful minuet would pop out!!! Now someone's done it on their
    compute, and you can hear the minuet on a MIDI player!! In fact, if
    you're reading this on the webpage, then you've probably heard one of
    the examples!!! If you were wondering why this page was sounding like a
    Discovery Channel documentary on the Rennaisence, now you know!!!!
    But if you don't have the plugin, you'll wonder what the hell I'm talking about!!!</p><p><i>(Update: you can hear it by pressing the "Play" button!)</i></p><p><a href="http://204.96.11.210/jchuang/Music/Mozart/mozart.cgi">http://204.96.11.210/jchuang/Music/Mozart/mozart.cgi</a></p>
