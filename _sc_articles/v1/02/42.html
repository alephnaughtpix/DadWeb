<p>You thought all that Lego business was stuff you left behind when
    you got a computer?!?!? Wrong!!! Lego are about to lauch "Mindstorm"-
    in other words, robotic Lego, which can interface with your compute!!!
    Interestingly enough, they're looking for beta-testers!!! Unfortunately,
    the application form requires you to specify what US state you come
    from!!! So I put my full addr with country and so on, and selected
    Wyoming for the state!!! So anyone from outside the US, I recommend you
    select "Wyoming" as a sort of code-word for "If it's US only, why the feck
    did you put the form on the Internet?!?!?!"</p><p><a href="http://www.legomindstorms.com/">http://www.legomindstorms.com/</a></p>
