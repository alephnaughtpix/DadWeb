    wierd name to learn that will be used all the time...</p><p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/top_stories/story.html?s=z/reuters/980715/news/stories/impotence_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/top_stories/story.html<br/>

    Though they'd better be quick because some bloke is suing the Viagra dudes.

    regret I ever heard of it"</i>!!!!</p><p> <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/top_stories/story.html?s=z/reuters/980716/news/stories/viagra_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/top_stories/story.html<br/>
