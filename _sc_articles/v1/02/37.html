    obviously said "Right!!! These young whippersnappers are using this
    webby thingy, and not reading too much of our paper stuff!!! Let's
    do some really original and spiffy website that they'll take notice
    of!!!" So they've done a web directory thingy like Yahoo, only it's
    a bit more serious!!! Oh yeah, they've called it "eBlast"!!! Wow!!!
