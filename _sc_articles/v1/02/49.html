<p>If I said "LCD screen", you'd think of a little digital watch or calcy
    wouldn't you?!?!?! Well, how about this- an LCD screen that's about as
    thick as a thick page in a book!!! That's what "Gyricon" is!!! The dudes
    in Xerox labs (you know the guys that invented WIMP and stuff!!) are
    thinking in terms of electronic books, newspapers, wallpaper and so on!!
    And they not settling for blocky displays either!!! They're aiming for
    400-600dpi which is the same resolution as a laser printer!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ingersoll-rand.com/compair/oct_nov_97/octnovco/oct_nov/pag_1.htm">http://www.ingersoll-rand.com/compair/oct_nov_97/octnovco/oct_nov/pag_1.htm</a></p>
