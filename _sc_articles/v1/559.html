<p>Have you ever wanted to do a fabby-dabby spoofy filmy like that
    "Lethal Titanic" or whatever it's called?!?!? Well, you might want
    to start by loading up your Netscape/IE/AOL browsey-wowsey with
    frames and javascript!!!!!!!!!! This is because someone's
    discovered that it's quite easy to "spoof" a frames-using site with
    Javascript!!! Someone could make up a page that looks a little like
    the site, and reload it in place of the real page from the site,
    and make it do something like ask for your password, and it's not
    obvious, because the URL in the top of the window points to the
    frameset, not the newly reloaded page!!!! Er, well, at least that's
    what they say here- I don't understand a word of it!!!!!! They do
    have a nice demonstration page tho...</p><p><a href="http://www.securexpert.com/framespoof/index.html">http://www.securexpert.com/framespoof/index.html</a></p>
