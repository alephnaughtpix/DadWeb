<p>And if you want something to play on your MP3Man, apart from Cliff and Oasis of course, 
    then you might be interested in this Chemical Brothers remix of some 
    Mecury Rev thingy... Because they've releasedas an MP3!!!!!!!! This 
    is courtesy of of the Ultimate Band Website, apparently !!!!!! Unfortunately 
    you have to enter your email addr or something, so just put in "po@tellytubbies.co.uk" 
    you arrive at this page!!!!</p><p><a href="http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/download/download.html">http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/download/download.html</a></p><p>Sorry, UBL, if you really want people to put in their email addrs 
    in to get the MP3, then don't put the downloads on a publicly accessible 
    page like that!!!!!! Of course, if they've got wind of this small 
    point, you may find that that URL doesn't work for you!!!! In which 
    case, you'll have to go here, and think of an "imaginative" email 
    address...</p><p><a href="http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/">http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/</a></p>
