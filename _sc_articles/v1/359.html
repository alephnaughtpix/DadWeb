<p>Have your ever listened to Jimmy Young on the radio and thought: <i>"I wonder
    what it would be like if he had the dudes from Slashdot on the
    show?!?!??!"</i> Well, <b>packet radio</b> is an old techies way that's been
    used for yonks to connect to the internet by a small group of people, and now
    some dude is working on making it really popular!!!!! So he's come up with
    this really spiffy personal 200 Mbits/second packet radio connection
    to the Internet for around $500 US dollars, which is 3,112.05 Danish Kroner,
    as well as 291.27 quid!!! (That Yahoo! Exchange Rate section is really
    informative isn't it?!?!?!?!?) The only prob is that here in the UK, the
    fuddie-duddies at the Radio Authority probably won't like the idea of
    the "great unwashed" getting their hands on cheapo radio transmitters!!!!!
    It certainly give a new meaning to "Internet Radio" tho!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://eetimes.com/story/OEG19981007S0014">http://eetimes.com/story/OEG19981007S0014</a></p>
