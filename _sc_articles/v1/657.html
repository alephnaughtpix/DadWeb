<p>You know those adverts from EA Sports for their football games, where you get some 
    cockney person going "Whahey!!! I'm mad about football me!!! etc", and 
    then they have some American voice saying "EASports!!!It'sInTheGame!!!!" 
    very quickly!!!!!! Well, you might ask, what is in the game!?!?!?! Well, 
    in this case, it's the pilot episode of that popular TV show "<b>South 
    Park</b>"!!!!!!!! Yep, someone decided to put a copy of the original 
    South Park story "<b>The Spirit of Christmas</b>" on the CD-Rom of one 
    of EA's games without telling anyone!!!!!!! If you've got the early 
    Playstation version of "<b>Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour</b>" then load the 
    CD-Rom into your PC, and see if you can find it!!!!!!!!!! Just don't 
    show it me, that's all!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/business/story/17393.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/business/story/17393.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
