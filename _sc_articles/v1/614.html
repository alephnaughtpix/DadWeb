<p>Well, it looks like <b>Image Radio</b> no longer has the monopoly on
    letting users make their own radio stations on tha inphopipe highway
    netweb thingy!!!!! Even more significantly, (We're using big words
    today, aren't we!!!!!!) it looks like <b>Realaudio</b>'s dominance
    in the webby audio streaming department is under threat!!!!</p><p>It's all thanks to this thingy called <b>Shoutcast</b> by Nullsoft-
    that's right it's the people behind <b>Winamp</b>!!!! What they've
    done is added a plugin to Winamp that allows whatever you're playing
    on Winamp (Whether it's MP3s, WAVs, MODs, YMs, etc.) to be streamed
    to a special Shoutcast server anywhere on tha netweb!!!!! Even better,
    you can download a server for Windows, and broadcast to the web on
    the same computer you're playing Winamp on!!!!! For you non-Windows
    peeps, there's also server proggies for quite a few non-wintel platforms...
    And it's all for free as well!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">http://www.shoutcast.com/</a>
<p>This idea has really caught the Slashdot crowd on the hop- they're
    looking for ways to take the Windows part out of the equation...</p>

<p>At the time of writing, we've been sampling (!!!!) some of the stations
    in the Shoutcast directory... By default all Shoutcast servers tell
    the main Shoutcast directory if they're broadcasting or not... (Which
    is quite handy if you're a Trading Standards person, and want to find
    out who's broadcasting copyrighted music on tha netweb without
    permission!!!!!!) In amongst the top 10 we found this little beauty!!!
    <b>Sub Ether Radio</b> broadcast whole uncut episodes of <b>The
    Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy</b>!!!!!! (And apparently they appear
    to be broadcasting the original radio episodes, rather than the
    versions released on the record...</p>

<p>Another interesting station (And one which is a bit more legit!!!!!)
    is <b>MP3.com</b>'s Top 40 Countdown, where you can hear loadsa
    unsigned acts on MP3.com's archives, which is really great, as you
    can listen to such jolly tunes as <b>X-Clan</b>'s
    "F&amp;$ked up world"!!!!!! (A brilliant reason if there ever
    was one!!!!!)</p>
