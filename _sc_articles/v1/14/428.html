<p>Is this what you do when you see adverts on the telly!?!??!?! Well, we can guess how chessed
    off you might be by ads on tha w3!!!!!!! Even if you avoid them, you still spend time
    downloading them!!!!!! Which is really annoying if they're the <i>"InterTrash Netware Solutions
    beat NetBlah by 0.01 on NASDAQ!!!!!! Buy our stuff!!!!!!!"</i> type bollox!!!!! Well, according
    to this lot, you can do it with their prog, which will even stop the ads downloading!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.intermute.com/">http://www.intermute.com/</a></p>
