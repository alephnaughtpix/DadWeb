MP3 SONG FILE:  ROCKIN RETARD BY THE WACKY BALL KICKERS


Dear You,

A neeet new band homepage has just arrived, and I think you'll like
it!  Hemorrhoy Rogers, Big Poo Generator, The Gland Puppies, The Wacky
Talkies, The Wacky Ball Kickers, Abe Lincoln and the Stincolns, and
Cowbots now have an official site:

<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~lobstar/HEMORRHOY.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~lobstar/HEMORRHOY.htm</a>

On this site there are fun games, thrilling stories, and AMAZING sound
files!  We swear that you'll twist a bowel from screaming in glee at
songs like Monkey Madness, and I Wanna Eat That Stuff There NOW!  The
sound files are being constantly updated - so hurry up and hurry back!
We aren't out to make money (at least not from this crap) - we're out
to go to the bathroom, silly!

WE GUARANTEE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD MUSIC LIKE THIS (UNLESS YOU'VE
HEARD FRANK SINATRA OR THE ROLLING STONES OR SOME COMMERCIAL I SAW
YESTERDAY)!  JUST LISTEN TO ONE SONG AND TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OR RUN TO
THE BATHROOM!

Please check it out, and, if you want, include it on any links list
you have or simply tell an enemy.  Hemorrhoy Rogers will ROCK
YOUR WORLD!!!

Sincerely,

Hemorrhoy Rogers
