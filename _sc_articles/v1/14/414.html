<p>How do you find out where the mines are in a minefield?!??!? Well, according
    to these people, you get in a helicopter, fly over the area, and shoot at
    it with a gun!!!!!! That's because the bullets in this case are radar
    transmitters!!!!!! You just shoot them into the ground, and use the radar
    emmissions to work out where the mines are!!!!!! Only problem tho- what
    if one of the bullets actually hit a mine?!?!?! Won't there be a big bang
    or something?!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981023/newscien/909100860-3356008450.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981023/newscien/909100860-3356008450.html</a></p>
