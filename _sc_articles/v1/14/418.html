<p>As you probably know when you're as old as you fogies (!!!), even
    established things can change!!!!!! For example, they got rid of Jeremy
    Beadle from "You've Been Framed!", and put on some big-boned woman in his
    place!!!!!! And in a similar way, the camcorder's going to change!!!! This
    week, the camcorder equivalent of those spiffy new digital cameras has been
    annouced!!! A digital movie camera- that records "stuff" as an MPEG file!!!!
    So in future when some French bloke says to you on IRC "Ta mere sur un mpeg en
    Internet", it won't be an insult, because she probably will be!!!! (Doing
    something nice and wholesome, of course!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.MPEGCam-eu.com/">http://www.MPEGCam-eu.com/</a></p>
