<p>Remember that extremely untrue story that was spread about "Captain Pugwash" sometime after it
    ended?!?!?!?! Some tabloid newspaper said that it was cancelled because there were characters
    such as "Master Bates", "Seaman Staines" and "Roger the Cabin Boy", and got their rear end sued
    by the BBC, who won because it was completely untrue!!!!!!!!! (Which is why we've got to keep
    saying that it's completely untrue, even though it is completely untrue anyway!!!!!!)
  <p>Well, it looks like it's happening again in the US- with the Teletubbies!!!!!! Some US parents
    are listening to their kids Teletubbies dolls, and are hearing swearwords!!! Especially the
    baby of the bunch, Po, who, according to who you talk to, is saying, "fagot,fogot,fagot", or
    "bite my butt!!!"!!!!! And Tinky Winky apparently even encourages drug use!!!!!!</p>
<p>Some parents must have really dirty minds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Now, look at these lemons!!!! If I went into the bbs and alleged that Barney the Dinosaur was
    a child molester, do you think they'd believe it?!?!?!?!??!!</p>

First Po is not cursing... She is say Fi-dit, fi-dit, fi-dit mar, mar,
man... Which means faster faster faster... Slower slower slower... and she
sings that when she is on her scooter which makes sense... I sorry for your
daughter that she is losing out on the enjoyment of a educationalt tv
show... She deserves quality entertainment... There is nothing wrong with
the show and it is not sick... it is actually well put together and full of
lessons... Again agian is NATURAL for children... that is when mom steps in
and say no... May be you too have a lot to learn from teletubbies... Also
each Tubby is a different nationality and personality... that teaches
children that we can all live together in peace no matter what skin color we
are or type of person we are as long as w all give each other "BIG Hugs" we
will all be happy... You should look at the teletubbies website and learn
about them instead of assuming that they are bad... Anyway I wisj you and
your daughter good luck... But I am glad we ( my daughter and I) FOund
teletubbies... She is so excited each time I turn it on the smile Makes me
happy to see her enjoy learning...

Good Luck,
Take Care,

Nikki

I. D. Kidd wrote in message ...
&gt;When my daughter first started watching The Teletubbies on television,
&gt;like most good parents, I was concerned that the babyish talk on the TV
&gt;screen would affect her speech patterns.  I don't want her demanding
&gt;something "Again! Again!" as that is plain bad manners.
&gt;
&gt;However, as she clearly seems to enjoy the programme, I continued to let
&gt;her watch it (after taking the time to teach her how to politely request
&gt;something).  After her friend got a Poh doll, we obviously treated Anna to
&gt;complete set of dolls - The new talking kind.
&gt;
&gt;She was delighted with the gift, and loves hearing them "talk" to her.
&gt;Imagine my shock when I heard her Tinky Dinky doll urge her to "Take an
&gt;'E'".
&gt;
&gt;I have played the dolls' voicebox many times, and it is clear that she is
&gt;urging my daughter to take drugs.  There is no other phrase I can think of
&gt;that could explain it.
&gt;
&gt;I have now stopped my daughter from watching this sick programme, and I
&gt;urge you all to join me in writing to the BBC to complain about this.  You
&gt;should write to:
&gt;
&gt; John Birt,
&gt; BBC Broadcasting House,
&gt; Wood Lane,
&gt; London W1.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your concern.
&gt;
&gt;Iain.
