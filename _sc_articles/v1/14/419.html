<p>Computer based electronic books are great aren't they?!?!!? Er, well,
    except when you want to read them on the train, that is!!!!! Lugging around
    a big clunky PC is not a good idea in the rush hour on the underground!!!!!
    Well, luckily you can now get teensy computes now!!!!!! So some bright sparks
    have decided to do "electronic books" for the Palm Pilot range, which is,
    oddly enough, book-sized!!!!!!! Mind you, you could always get a web
    browser, and view our pages on the Palm Pilot!!!!!!</p><p>That would certainly be a good read!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.peanutpress.com/index.cgi?05091471-3356008450">http://www.peanutpress.com/index.cgi?05091471-3356008450</a></p>
