<p>One of the big ultra-hyped thingies that's been hyped about ever since
    the hype about the internet got hyped up like a load of really hyped-up
    mega-hype, is video-on-demand!!!!! But so far, the nearest we've come to it
    is those funny "Front Row"/"Box Office" type thingies where you can pay
    something to watch some film at 8:43pm or whatever... Well, apparently
    some company has actually worked out how to make video on demand commercially
    viable- by compressing stuff really well or something neat like that!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981024/hitech/909249019-19981024ai.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981024/hitech/909249019-19981024ai.html</a></p>
