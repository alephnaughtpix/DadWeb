<p>You might have vaguely heard that the American Record Industry were fuming over these MP3
    players, because they can use any old MP3s, even "dodgy" ones downloaded from those funny
    "h/p/v/a/c/z/d/g/w/r/t/e/q" sites!!!!! (Erm, hang on, can't Walkmans play "dodgy" cassettes
    as well?!?!?!?!?) Last week they tried to stop an MP3 player so that they could reclassify
    it as a "recorder" so that it's also got a tax on it to compensate the industry for all the
    money they lose when people use the recorders to tape all their extremely expensive
    records!!!!!! This week <i>"U.S. Central District Court of California, Judge Audrey Collins,
    denied the Recording Industry Association of America's (RIAA) application seeking a Preliminary
    Injunction to halt shipment of Diamond Multimedia's Rio PMP300 portable music player."</i> ...
    Er, which means that the player isn't delayed any more!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15847.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15847.html</a></p><p>$120?!?!? That's about 60 quids!!!! Hmmmm....</p>
