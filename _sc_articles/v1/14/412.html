<p>Well, it's quite a few years before "First Contact", but already we've got a Star Trekky "ion drive"
    appearing on this space probe which is called "Deep Space One"!!! Maybe they'll get an "impulse drive"
    ready for Deep Space Two!??!?! And by the time Deep Space Nine comes about, maybe we'll have bumped
    into a few aliens, and decide to call them "cardassians" and "bajorans" or something like that!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/space/9810/24/deep.space.01/">http://cnn.com/TECH/space/9810/24/deep.space.01/</a></p>
