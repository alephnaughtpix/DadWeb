<p>We've already noted this new-fangled idea of online shopping search agents
    before, but apparently this is the ultra-hyper-top-mega-spangly one!!!! Or
    as they say, the "world's most intelligent shopping search engine"!!! And
    it's called ... "<b>mySimon</b>"!!!!!!!! I ask you!!!!!!!!!! What a really
    really really really really really stupid name!!!!!!!! (I would have called
    it "Spangly Shopper", because it's a site for shoppers, and it's spangly!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.mysimon.com/">http://www.mysimon.com/</a></p><p>But we're lucky we did find this site, because otherwise we wouldn't have
    found this gem!!!! We were looking for copies of Clive Dunn's classic
    gramophone recording "Grandad", but we couldn't find that, so we looked for the Spice
    Girls instead!!!!! One of the record shops that came up was a store called...
    *<b>Abby Road</b>* !!!!!!!!!!! Not only that, but we went to their website, and
    it's the crappiest looking webpage by an online record store we have ever seen!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.abbyroad.com/">http://www.abbyroad.com/</a></p>
