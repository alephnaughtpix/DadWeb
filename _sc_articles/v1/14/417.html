<p>Well, this has really got the Slashdot crowd really pleased!!!!!! Apparently
    there's housing being sold in the US which includes super-duper inphoweb
    connections and Quake 2 servers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And we really like the
    name "Walden Internet Villages"!!!!! It would be even better if they got
    Brian Walden down to do a special edition of "Weekend World" from there!!!!!
    Then he would be say: "Hello, Im Brian Walden, broadcasting from Walden
    Internet Villages"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/10/26/2046209.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/10/26/2046209.shtml</a></p>
