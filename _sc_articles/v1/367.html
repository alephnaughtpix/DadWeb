<p>If you like "double entendres", then you'll like this!!!!! We're talking about something 
    that a lot of people on the InfoPipeWebHighway do a lot when they're 
    surfing!!!! Everytime they point and click at a link, it's because they're 
    wanting to do "it"!!!! In fact, they can't really surf without doing 
    "it"!!!!! I am of course talking about using the mouse, you dirty people!!!! 
    But you can do something else with your hands, believe it or not!!!!! 
    You can "twiddle" with your "Twiddler"!!!!! That's because the "Twiddler" 
    is an intresting combination of the a mouse and that neat 5-key keyboard 
    replacement thingy that came out in the 80s!!!!! I notice you have to 
    "grip" it in a certain way.... </p><p><a href="http://www.handykey.com/">http://www.handykey.com/</a></p>
