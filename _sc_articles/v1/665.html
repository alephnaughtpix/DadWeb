<p>Well, we might 
    have been a bit retisent (Is that how you spell it?!?) to get one of 
    those Rio MP3 players, because after all it's the first of the bunch, 
    and you can imagine what the first Sony Walkman was like!!!!!!!!! But 
    we might get one now!!!!!!!! That's because, thanks to some spiffy new 
    open source software, you can now use it as a mobile hard drive!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Yes, that's right, thanks to this stuff, you can download and upload 
    files from your Rio, and not just MP3/Wavs either!!!!! There are two 
    versions of this software, one is more "Windowsy" and the other is more 
    "Linuxy"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://welcome.to/riogeo">http://welcome.to/riogeo</a> </p><p><a href="http://www.world.co.uk/sba/rio.htm">http://www.world.co.uk/sba/rio.htm</a> </p><p>We found out about this by way of a very nice new MP3 news site 
      called <b>MP3 Place</b>!!!!! Check it out!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.mp3place.com/">http://www.mp3place.com/</a>
<p>At least they haven't gone completely mad about this new development!!!! 
      Unlike <b>Wired News</b>, who seem to getting more hysterical of late!!!!!!!!!! 
      Which we're sure is nothing to do with the fact that they're now that 
      they're basically just a big news service after all the "trendy" bits 
      of Wired Digital were chopped by their new owners!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="8.html#251"> 
      issue 8</a>...) We've already reported on them trying to get "hip" 
      again with that "drugs" story, (See <a href="22.html#647"> issue 22</a>...) 
      now they're reporting this story, giving it an "Oh woe is MP3 now!!!!!!! 
      And all because these wily hackers have torpodoed the Rio by making 
      it doing something that the Recording Industry of America won't like!!!!!!!!" 
      type spin!!!!!!!! </p>
