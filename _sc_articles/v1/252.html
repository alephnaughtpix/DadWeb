<p>Well, it was only a matter of time!!!! <b>Excel 97</b>'s got it's own
    macro "Basic" language" just like <b>Word 97</b>, so it was only a matter
    of time before someone did a macro virus on that was well!!! What's really
    special about this one, is that it's compatible with both Word and Excel,
    and can jump between the two types of file!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?98091.wnshiver.htm">http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?98091.wnshiver.htm</a></p>
