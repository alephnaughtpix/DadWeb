<p>According this somewhat interesting story, by the time that flipping St** W**s film comes
    out over here (In Scotland!!!!) Microsoft might be going along the road of charging users
    an annual fee to use Windows!!!! Given that Windows is used on most computes in tha world,
    it's a bit like charging computers to breathe air!!!!!!!!!!!!! So sort it, Mr Gates, before
    every poor person becomes a geek Linux nerd propellor-head as those ZD-Net people say!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29088,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29088,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh</a></p>
