<p>Now I bet you 
    didn't know that some scientests were doing a "Sloan Sky Survey"!!!! 
    Even more, amazing, they're not doing it from Sloane Square, but from 
    the Hubble Telescope!!!!!!!!! In this story, they've found these things 
    called "quasars", (Which sounds like an early 80s yuppy wine bar, doesn't 
    it?!?!?!?) and one in particular is apparently the furthest known visible 
    object in space!!!!! Apparently it's got a "redshift" of 5.0!!!!!! What 
    that means, we don't know- but it sounds pretty far from Sloane Square 
    anyway!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_231000/231728.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_231000/231728.stm</a></p>
