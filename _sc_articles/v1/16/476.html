<p>What do you usually 
    do when you get on tha blower to tha "old man"?!?!?!?! Do you say: "Allo 
    me old muckah!!!! It's good to taaawwwlk!!!!!"?!?!?! Or do you sing 
    down the phone: "I am the telephone operator!!! (Beep!!! Beep!!!)" in 
    a German accent?!?!?!! Well, if it's the latter, then this might be 
    for you!!!!! Because technology has now reached it's pinnacle of excellence!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Well.......... maybe not, but this is a great milestone around the necks 
    of technology!!!!!! Karaoke on tha phonnnee!!!!!!!! But this is not 
    any karaoke!!!! This one has 20,000 chunky chunes in it!!!!! That means 
    it's probably one of the few online services that actually has Clive 
    Dunn's "Grandad" in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/template/Tec-Template.idc?artid=19981102214923011&amp;top=tec&amp;template=Default.htx&amp;maxfieldsize=4441">http://www.scmp.com/news/template/Tec-Template.idc?<br/>
