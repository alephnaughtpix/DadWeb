<p>If you're worried 
    about all thos security forces tapping into your computer using funny 
    rays or whatever they use, then you might like this little laptop from 
    Wang!!!! It's got this spiffy technology called <b>Tempest</b>, which 
    of course is named after the populat text editing program on the Atari!!!!!!! 
    It can stop people with funny technology eavesdropping on your machine!!! 
    And it can even protect against an electromagnetic pulse damaging your 
    equipement, so if any Johnny Foreigner gets bored with attempting to 
    spy on your computer, and instead just lobs an atomic bomb in your vague 
    direction, the massive electromagnetic pulse caused by zillions of atoms 
    engaging in an atomic chain-reaction will not zilch out your compute!!!! 
    (Well, unless of course, they just land a bomb *<b>on</b>* the compute!!!! 
    I don't think Tempest can quite protect against that!!!!!!)</p><p>As Scotty might say: "It cannae go W(r)ang!!!!" (Doh!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16132.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16132.html</a></p>
