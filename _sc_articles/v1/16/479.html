<p>After Jon Katz 
    stopped writing for Hotwired, (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) 
    we thought we wouldn't see too much of him after that, but the opposite 
    has happened!!!!!!! In fact, a whole load of sites we visit regularly 
    now have Jon Katz columns!!!!! First, there was the Freedom Forum site, 
    then the Newstrolls column (See <a href="11.html#321"> issue 11</a>...) 
    .... Now he's on Slashdot!!! It started when he did some column on the 
    Freedom Forum site about Slashdot publicising the MS "Halloween Memo" 
    (See <a href="15.html#449"> issue 15</a>...) ...</p><p><a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/technology/1998/11/6katz.asp">http://www.freedomforum.org/technology/1998/11/6katz.asp</a></p><p>Slashdot linked to this, and all the usual geek propellor-head nerds 
    slagged Katz off for getting some technical thingies wrong, so he 
    was invited to do an "upgraded version" for Slashdot!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/09/1124251.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/09/1124251.shtml</a></p><p>But near the end of this week, <i>another</i> column by Katz appeared!!!! 
    Is this going to be a regular thing, we wonder?!?!?!?!</p><p> <a href="http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/10/2119244.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/10/2119244.shtml</a></p>
