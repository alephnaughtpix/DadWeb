<p>There are quite 
    a few things you might expect from Comdex, one of the world's biggest 
    fairs, but one of things you may *<i>not</i>* be expecting is people 
    wearing the various components of a Gnome!!!!!!! If you think that's 
    weird, how about thos ewho wear the various constituent parts of a Gimp!??!?! 
    Or even an Apache?!?!?!? As some of you slightly speedier readers might 
    have guessed by now, this is because some company are going to debut 
    a wearable Linux computer!!!! So you'll be able to run Gnome, Gimp, 
    Apache or whatever on a computer that's a little easier to carry around 
    than my current Linux box, <b>"Godzilla"</b>!!!! And it'll probably 
    crash a lot less than my Windows 95 box, <b>"James Dean"</b>!!!!!
