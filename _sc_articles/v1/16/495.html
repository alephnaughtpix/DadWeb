<p>What do you mean, 
      "What's a 'Memory controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure 
      of speculation on the physical nature of a component being addressed'?!?!?!?" 
      Well, erm, I don't know really, but it's one of the first actual proper 
      things that have com out of the world's most hyped company ever, *<b>Transmeta</b>*!!!!!! 
      The company, run by Paul Allen, who along with Bill Gates, founded Microsoft, 
      and which also employs Linus Torvalds (Yep!! Mr Linux!!!!), has been 
      very very secretive about what's it's actually doing, so this patent 
      that it's filed for a "Memory controller for a microprocessor for detecting 
      a failure of speculation on the physical nature of a component being 
      addressed" is something interesting!!!!!!!!! I'm not exactly sure what 
      it does, but you can be sure that this time next year, the phrase "Memory 
      controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation 
      on the physical nature of a component being addressed" will be on everyone's 
      lips!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05832205__&amp;s_clms=1">http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05832205__&amp;s_clms=1</a></p><p>This lot here apparently know what the "Memory controller for a 
      microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation on the physical 
      nature of a component being addressed" actually does!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28737,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28737,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a></p>
