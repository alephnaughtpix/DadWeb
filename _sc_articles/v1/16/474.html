<p>What's on the web and quacks!??!?!?! Well, according to this news story,
    some doctors!!!! A lot of "proper" doctors have come to the surprising
    conclusion that some "cyberdoc" wesbites are run by quacks, and have warned
    that they might get it wrong!!!!!! For example one "doc" recommended 'two
    bowel movements', whilst another suggested 'Red Clover and Dandelion', which
    was oddly enough available from the "Doc" at a small cost!!!!! One even
    suggested 'two apples a day', which is really stupid, since as everyone
    knows, "an apple a day...", so two apples is like a polite way of telling
    your patient to "rack off"!!!!! (As they say in those Australian soaps!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_209000/209155.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_209000/209155.stm</a></p>
