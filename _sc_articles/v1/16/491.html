<p>Well, perhaps 
    this next lot might take notice!!!!!!!! At the same time as Avatars 
    98, a conference called <b>Webzine 98</b> is taking place!!!!! As soon 
    as I heard of it, I though "Aha!!!! Webzines!!!!! It must be online 
    then!!!!! I'll be able to advertise my esteemed organ on it!!!! (By 
    which I of course mean "Senior Citizen", you dirty minded people!!!!!!!!) 
    Then I went to the website, and I find out that... It's not online 
    at all!!!!! It's taking place in San flippin' Francisco!!!!!!!! Talk 
    about missing the flippin' point!!!!!!!!! </p><p>And the website isn't exactly the world's best design either!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.webzine98.com/">http://www.webzine98.com/</a></p>
