<p>When you set the cache size on your web browsey-wowsey, do you set it to a
    couple of megs!?!?! Well, maybe in the future, you'll be like this lot, and
    set it to a couple of million megs!!!! The UKs largest web cache has just
    opened to help ISPs store web pages frequently accessed by their users, and
    it can store a terabyte of data!!!!!!! One of the people behind this seems
    really enthusiastic about it: <i>"A terabyte represents an incredible amount
    of storage. For instance, if a book were to contain the same amount of
    information, it would be 32,000 feet high - taller than Mount Everest,"</i>!!!!!</p><p>Wow!!!!!!!!!! That must be enough for about a couple of weeks worth of
      "jazz" and "appz" for UK users!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mirror-image.com/">http://www.mirror-image.com/</a></p>
