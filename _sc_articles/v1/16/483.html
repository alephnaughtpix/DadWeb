<p>Well, this rather 
    surprising article comes from the UK broadsheet newspaper for what you 
    American people call "liberals"!!!!!!!! It's actually yet another of 
    the "in-depth" pieces that came about as a result of the extremely slow 
    reaction of the mainstream media to the MS "Halloween Memo", (See <a href="15.html#449"> 
    issue 15</a>...) but the closing sentence is a bit of a surprise: <i>"If 
    you have Microsoft shares, prepare to sell them now"</i>!!!!!! Wow!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://reports.guardian.co.uk/articles/1998/11/8/32026.html">http://reports.guardian.co.uk/articles/1998/11/8/32026.html</a></p>
