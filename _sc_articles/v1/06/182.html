<p>Well, looks like at least someone's not taking this bloody MONICA LEWINSKY (hello
    again NSA people!!) business too seriously!!! (I mean, politician having it off

    guessed it, it's a flipping washing powder ad!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/od/story.html?s=v/nm/19980817/od/scandal_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/od/story.html?s=v/nm/19980817/od/scandal_1.html</a></p>
