<p>Talking of funny bacteria, how about putting some in your screen?!?!?! Well, that's what
    Bell labs are wanting to do!!! They're now working on ultra-thin screens which use
    bacteria proteins which change according to electrical charge. So if your screen
    "dies", it'll give a new meaning to "bugs" and "viruses"!!!! (Doh!!!!!!) I suppose
    you could call those bacteria screens "Technical <b>YUKKY</b>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Arg!!! Nurse!!!!!!)</p><p>Oh no- I've said "bugs"!!!! The NSA people will be reading this again!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/98/1022news/offbeat.html">http://www.eetimes.com/news/98/1022news/offbeat.html</a></p>
