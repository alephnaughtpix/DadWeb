<p>Haven't you ever thought... Well, obviously you have!!!! Well, now
    you can record it!!!! Some company's done this thingy called an
    Interactive Brainwave Visual Analyzer, and are giving a bit of a
    plug on their rather interesting webpage!!! Apparently you
    put this funny band with electrodes in around your head and you
    can control software and stuff... But's really boring!!! What we
    found really interesting were some of the wacky phrases they were
    coming up with on their webpage, like... <i>"Let your brain do
    it's brain thing", "Technical Yummy!", "Check the Freak'n
    Software!!!!", "The ultimate machine based mind extender????!"</i>,
    and loads of other gems!!!! We're printing out this webpage in
    case we need some inspiration!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.IBVA.com/IBVA%20docs/IBVAcore.html">http://www.IBVA.com/IBVA%20docs/IBVAcore.html</a></p><p>We also like what someone said on Slashdot about it...</p><pre class="usenet">Nite
