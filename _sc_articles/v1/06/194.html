<p>Ever since Colostomy Bag told me about this new fangled MP3 thing, I've been 
    interested to see what resources there are on the fabulous megamighty infowebby 
    thingy!!! So I subscribed to a couple of the MP3 Usenet groups... When I suddenly 
    found I was having to download a few meg a day of crap incomplete UUencoded 
    MP3s, I decided perhaps it wasn't such a good idea!!! (You know the sort of 
    thing- some Korn track or whatever, UUencoded into 7 parts, except that part 4 
    is missing, and there's 2 copies of part 3!!!)</p><p>What I did get from the messages tho was a few links to various "unofficial" 
    download sites!!!! (Woo!!! Naughty or what!!!) So, Old Fart, serious investigative 
    journalist (!!!!!), went along and had a look at a few of the sites!!!</p><p>Of course I have to say here that downloading copyrighted music
    is not big and not clever!!!!! However, neither are the sites!!!! Some
    of them are really crap!!!! Some of them appear to be linked with those
    "warez" sites, which is probably why they've got loads of porno ads all
    over them and why they have the world's worst web design!!!!!!</p><dl>
<dt><b>"MP3 2000"</b></dt>
<dd>This promises much, but most of it's not bloody working!!! Try
      testing the site before you advertise it on Usenet, you idiots!!</dd>
<dt><b>"MP3 Charts"</b></dt>
<dd>This is really interesting!!!! It's a sort of Top of the Pops of
      MP3s!!!! All the usual chart stuff you see on the chart shows are
      on here!! Unfortunately for the same reason, it's not really full
      of stuff you'd want to download!!!!</dd>
<dt><b>"Rock, Pop &amp; Rap MP3s"</b></dt>
<dd>Bit wierd this one- it apparently has "rock, pop &amp; rap", but is
      rather broad in what it considers... "Pop" includes Aqua and Eric
      Clapton, whilst rap is really wide- Rage Against the Machine's
      "Killing in the Name" rub shoulders with German ravey guys
      Scooter!!!</dd>
<dt><b>"Top 50 MP3 Sites"</b></dt>
<dd>This site, which is a Top 50 list of other MP3 sites, is one of the most
      irritating websites I have ever had the mispleasure of visiting!!!!
      Windows pop from nowhere when you select something- then you get
      the top 50 list, and after 10 seconds, the browser suddenly loads
      another page advertising the rest of the site!!!! When you select
      sites, some may pop up in yet another window or they may not!!!
      As soon as I actually got something from this site, I just picked
      a link and left quickly!!!!</dd>
<dt><b>"MP3 Sound page"</b></dt>
<dd>This site looks like one of those mysterious "warez" sites you hear
      of, but the choice appears reasonable.... Interestingly, the version
      of Aqua's "Barbie Girl" is completely different from the original!!! It
      purports to be a "remix" but sounds suspiciously like someone
      in their back bedroom knocking together a "happy hardcore" track
      on a couple of cheap MIDI keyboards, and overlaying a bad sample
      of the vocals at the start of the original!!!! Just as well I had to
      delete it so as to stay within the law!!!! (Officer!!!)</dd>
<dt><b>"MPFreeLand"</b></dt>
<dd>This is a a little better- there's a bit more of an interesting
      and varied choice of music here, including rather Dire Strait's
      "Telegraph Road"!!!! Hmm... yes, I'm sure someone will be brave
      enough to try and download this 14 minute track!!!! They'll
      need a whole day to download it tho!!!! Mind you, it's not all worthy muso stuff,
      I also saw they had listed that delightful "what's she going to look like
      with a chimney on her" ditty!!!!</dd>
</dl><p>What?!?! You expected me to give the URLs?!?!?!? You're mad!!!!</p>
