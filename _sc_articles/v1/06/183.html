<p>Well, I've been getting really interested in the various new tiny computers that
    are coming out, especially those than can run the same systems you get on biggy
    computers!!!! One of the "big names" is Palm Computing, who do those PalmPilots,
    which apparently are the fastest selling new hardware since the Mac came out, or
    something like that... Anyway, their latest is going to have a colour display, and
    have spiffy infrared connections to the "big" PCs, and they're even talking about
    wireless connections!!! It's apparently called "Razor" or something, so I'll be
    able to say: "I've got a wireless and razor in my pocket, just like I did in the
    War!!"!!!!!! (I had big pockets though!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,25419,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,25419,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a></p>
