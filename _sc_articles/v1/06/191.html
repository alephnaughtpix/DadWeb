<p>Well, it had to happen sometime!!!! You'll be glad to know that when everyone's 
    using Java OS on their toasters and hairdryers, that they'll still be able 
    to get viruses on them!!! The makers of this virus must have a bit of a sense 
    of humour, as they've called the virus "Strange Brew"!!!!!!!!! (!!!!) I don't 
    know about the claim on the article here that it's the first cross platform 
    virus- I mean, all the Microsoft Word viruses are work on both Macs and PCs!!!! 
    (How do you think they become the most widely spread viruses in the world?!?!?)</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980819/ca_symante_2.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980819/ca_symante_2.html</a></p><p>As usual, the Slashdot crew are pretty sceptical...</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/980820/0851222.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/980820/0851222.shtml</a></p>
