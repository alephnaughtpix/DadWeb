<p>Anyone jealous at the US getting the first look of the next
    Star Wars movie?!?! Well, don't be, because the fact that
    they're getting it first means that it might be more
    expensive for them to see it there!!! Apparently the fact
    that no-one really knows exactly how it's going to perform
    (Well, you never know, it might not do well!!! Aliens might
    land before May 1999, or a meteorite might hit New York!!!!),
    combined with the fact that it's most anticipated movie
    of all time, means that the cinemas might hike up the price
    just in case it's a dud!!! They figure that the people who be
    wanting to see it first won't be too fussy about paying
    higher prices!!!</p><p>At least by the time it hits everywhere, we'll know if
    it's a success or not, so the ticket price probably will have
    settled down by then!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=1850&amp;next=1">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=1850&amp;next=1</a></p>
