<p>We've only just found out about this at the last minute!!!! 15th Aug is the 
    deadline if you want your name to go into space, so it'll be too late now!!! 
    Some satellite is going into space with a couple of microchips with squillions 
    of people's names on it, and has allowed people to submit names... So of 
    course, we've put all the names of the Senior Dads into the list!!! Tho, 
    who knows what aliens will think when they see the following names...</p><pre class="usenet">Old Fart
