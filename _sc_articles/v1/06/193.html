<p>Ever wondered where 90% of the galaxy's mass has gone to?!?! Well, so have 
    astronomoners!!! They've worked out that there are these massive objects called 
    "machos" which steal all the mass!!!! I wonder if that makes our sun a 
    "wimpy"!?!?! Seeing as our sun doesn't really have a name, maybe we should 
    start calling it "Walter"!!!!!!!!!!!!! (!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/073264.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/073264.htm</a></p>
