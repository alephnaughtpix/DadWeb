<p>If you put a billion monkeys in front of a billion typewriters typing at random, 
    they would reproduce the entire collected works of Usenet in about ... five 
    minutes.</p><p>You might think I'm being clever!!! But in fact, I'm not!!!! In fact, it's a 
    quote from someone, and I got it from this spiffy place called "Quoteland", which 
    has, erm, loads of quotations!!!!! So you can, like, quote things and stuff.</p><p><a href="http://www.quoteland.com/">http://www.quoteland.com/</a></p>
