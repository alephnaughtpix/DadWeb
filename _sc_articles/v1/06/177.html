<p>Well, comparatively cheap anyway by US standards!!! Someone's selling
    a PC with 180MZh Cryix MMX thingy procesa, 22 Migo Ram, 1.6 gigawatts
    HD, 24 speedy CD, 33.6 kilojoules per second modem for $399, which is
    Â£250 in UK prices... So they've managed in the US to get round to
    a PC that costs the same as the ol' Beeb Model A used to cost!!! I
    can't wait till they get round to making the PC as reliable as the
    old Beeb tho!!!! Technical yummy!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980813S0012">http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980813S0012</a></p>
