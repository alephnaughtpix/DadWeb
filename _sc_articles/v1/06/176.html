<p>And you thought the Spartan Horse was what William Wallace rode in
    the film Braveheart!!!! Well, you're wrong!!!!! It's actually use of
    a Javascript dialog thingy in a web page to look like a Windows
    dialog, so it can fool the user into typing stuff like a password
    request and similar naughty stuff!!!! Oddly enough, made-up Javascript
    windows and dialogs look more like Windows dialogs if you're using
    Micrsoft Internet Explorer!!!! Looks like this integrating the browser
    into the operating system wasn't such a good idea!!!!!</p><p>So if you ever surf with IE, and get confronted with a strange "Windows"
    dialog asking you for your password, just "Let your brain do
    it's brain thing"!!!! (That's another phrase from the webpage, great
    isn't it?!?!?!)</p><p><a href="http://www.thetopoftheworld.com/spartanhorse/">http://www.thetopoftheworld.com/spartanhorse/</a></p>
