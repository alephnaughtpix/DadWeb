<p>Looks like what was first thought to be a millenium bug, then an
    end-of-every-year bug (See <a href="5.html#156"> issue 5</a>...), 
    is actually an end-of-every-day bug!!!! If you boot your computer
    at 11:59 at night, the date in your clock goes funny!!!!! To MS we
    say: "Check the Freak'n software"!!!!!! (That's another phrase from
    the webpage, BTW!!! Great, eh!?!?!?)</p><p><a href="http://news.com/News/Item/0,4,25298,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://news.com/News/Item/0,4,25298,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a></p>
