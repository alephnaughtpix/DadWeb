<p>A talking penguin!!!! In fact, it's a talking robot penuin with intelligence!!!!
    As usual, MIT are to blame for this one!!! It's one of their robot thingies, which
    is actually meant to be a teaching tool, to teach kiddies about computer and
    robots!!! Though I think it will probably scare them to death, especially if they're
    French, because the thingie's called "Mort", and "Mort" is French for "dead"!!!!!!
    But it's "technical yummy" anyway!!! (That's a phrase from that webpage, BTW!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://ttt.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/Mort/mort.html">http://ttt.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/Mort/mort.html</a></p>
