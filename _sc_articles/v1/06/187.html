<p>Have you ever wondered what it will be like to be a gravedigger on the moon 
    in the year 3543?!?!! Well some people are going to find out this 
    week, as there's an expedition to the frozen bits in north of Norway, where 
    it's colder than a snowman's cold bits (!!!!), and people are going to dig 
    up graves whilst wearing spacesuits!!!! The reason being that they believe 
    that in the permafrost there may still be frozen traces of the Spanish flu 
    (??? Maybe they misspelled "Spanish Fly" or something!!!! Though what it's 
    doing in Norway is beyond me!!!! Perhaps he took a wrong turn at Alberquerque 
    like Bugs Bunny!!!!!!) which was apparently really bad during the First World 
    War, and they want to get a vaccine against it and so on... One thing tho- how 
    do they know if they've got the bug!?!?! I mean, they'll catch their death 
    of cold up in the Arctic Circle anyway!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/011613.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/011613.htm</a></p>
