<p>What am I talking about?!?! News Trolls of course!!!!! As in trawling the web for 
    news!! Really handy if you're looking for wierd web stories like me!!! The idea 
    was started by someone with the really sensible name "Pasty Drone", who used the 
    "threads" forum in Hotwired to post pointers to loads of interesting news stories 
    from loadsa websites!!!! It caught on with a few more people, and now the crew are 
    on a whole website dedicated to it!!! Tho I think they should really be reading 
    Senior Citizen for the really hot tips!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/">http://www.newstrolls.com/</a></p>
