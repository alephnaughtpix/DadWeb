<p>"And now, we're solid!!!!! (Wooh!!! Yeah!! etc) Solid as a rock!!!!!!"
    So sang <b>Ashford &amp; Simpson</b> in the 1980s, (And so did some of my friends,
    except that did a very rude version, which substituted "rock" for a very rude word!!!!)
    but I bet they wouldn't say the same about rocks with rock eating microbes in
    them!! These microbes have been found one mile below the surface of the sea by
    an ocean drilling program. Well, not actually the microbes themselves, but fossils
    of them... Sounds familiar!?!?! Yep, it's like that story about the meteorite from
    Mars with funny marks that might be microbe fossils. They're a bit more sure about
    the sea ones tho, so it's started up the Mars meteorite debate again!! I think the
    scientests had better let their brain do their collective brain thing!!!!! (OK, I'll
    go easy on those hip phrases now!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.gene.com/ae/WN/SU/rockeater898.html">http://www.gene.com/ae/WN/SU/rockeater898.html</a></p>
