<p>According to this interesting little article, the US shadowy types you see on the
    <i>X-Files</i>, the <b>National Security Agency (NSA)</b> have this system called <b>Echelon</b>,
    which can intercept emails going in and out and around the US which contain key phrases
    they're looking for!!! Just think- our mailing list is provided by a US server,
    so we can immediately increase our readership just by using key phrases like
    "subversive activities", "hacking", "Iraqi chemical weapons programme", "bombing
    of US embassy in Kenya", and "Monica Lewinsky"!!! Anyway, hello NSA people- hope
    you like this issue!!!! Oh, and "Let your brain do it's brain thing"!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/news/33vest.shtml">http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/news/33vest.shtml</a></p>
