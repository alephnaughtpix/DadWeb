<p>You know, last night, I saw the Beatles "Blue" compil on sale on CD on QVC- for 
    Â£29.40!!!!!! Flippin' eck!!! You can get the thing on vinyl for a few quid 
    secondhand!!! What do you mean, "get on with it!!"?!?!?! Well, there's a lot 
    more of this online shopping lark happening, so you may soon be shopping 
    from the odd US site here and there, so how do you know you're not getting 
    ripped off?!?! Well, here's one idea- there's now a search engine for online 
    shoppers, so you can compare prices!!!! So you can make sure that there's 
    no QVC style ripoffs- I mean, they were also selling the "Red" compil for 
    Â£29.40!!!!! The "Red" compil's so small it can fit in a single CD, so I'm 
    not paying a flippin' pound per track!!!! Fume, fume!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.bottomdollar.com/">http://www.bottomdollar.com/</a></p><p>And to help you convert dollars to pounds, go here...</p><p><a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/m3?u">http://quote.yahoo.com/m3?u</a></p>
