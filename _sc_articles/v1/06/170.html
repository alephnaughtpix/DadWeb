<p>Literally!!!! It's made of recycled rubbish from New York, 
    and has just sailed from New York, across the Atlantic, to London!!!! Presumably 
    the crew were wearing noseplugs or something!!! I hope there wasn't a dustbin 
    lorry at the London port, or the boat might not have lasted very long!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9808/14/trash.boat.reut/">http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9808/14/trash.boat.reut/</a></p>
