<p>Well, this is a new angle on "Net=bad" type stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently,
    according to this story, some Italian guy surfed the net for <b>three WHOLE
    DAYS</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And at the end of that mammoth surf, he ended up
    suffering from hallucinations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>We expect there will now be tons of articles about people getting
    hallucinations from surfing the net, and someone will probably get round to
    making some really bad puns vis a vis "virtual reality" or something like
    that!!!!!! The funny thing is that I saw this telly documentary on sleep some
    time ago, and apparently there was experiments on sleep deprivation, and they
    found that people who didn't sleep got hallucinations!!!!!!!!! So what's this
    story got to do with tha NetWeb then?!?!?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.techserver.com/story/body/0,1634,23929-38849-283980-0,00.html">http://www.techserver.com/story/body/<br/>
