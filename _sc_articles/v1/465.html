<p>Another biggie name joins the MP3 format- Platinum Entertainment!!!!!!! What do you mean,
    "who?"!?!?!??! Over the next few months, the record company are going to start releasing some
    choons from their archives- so we hope to see some free MP3s by such big names as "The Band"
    and stuff from the latest album by none other than 80s popular music legend Taylor Dayne!!!!!!</p><p>I can't wait!!!!!! But I probably will have to- as I have a rubbish net connection!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16034.html?all">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16034.html?all</a></p>
