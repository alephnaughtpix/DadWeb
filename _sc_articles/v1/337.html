<p>We went on IRC last Sunday (27/09/1998), and immediately got quizzed by
    <b>Evl</b> of <b>Dead Hackers Society</b> about a mysterious crew called
    "<b>The Poets of Bombay</b>" Well, we just heard about this mysterious crew
    through a release we saw at the <b>Reservoir Gods Cwmvention</b> the
    previous week!!! It turns out that someone calling themselves "<b>Muhatma
    Ghandhi</b>" had mailed 20 copies of a 560K demo to Evl, and as a result
    of his full mailbox the whole system had come to a standstill!!!!! As a
    result, the demo is getting a plug on the DHS site, but he forwarded one
    of the mails to us. After working out how the hell to run the demo (It
    turns out that the demo is for an Atari Faclon using a VGA display!!!),
    we watched it, and were a little surprised to find a completely different
    demo to the one we saw at the Cwmvention- these dudes must be a little
    busy!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.dhs.org/">http://www.dhs.org/</a></p>
