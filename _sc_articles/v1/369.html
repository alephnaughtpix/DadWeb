<p>Some Daily Mail 
    readers were a bit put "out" by the Teletubbies because they thought 
    that they might teach children to talk funny!!!! Well, most young people 
    today talk funny anyway, so I don't think the stuck up prigs would notice 
    any difference, would they?!?!?! I mean, these no-good busybodies really 
    get right up my noses, and ... erm, anyway!!!!!! At least the wonderful 
    tubby creatures didn't teach the kids to swear!!!!! But a bit of US 
    educational softs has!!!!! In fact, the programmer deliberately put 
    words like "masterb&amp;^*" into a spelling game as a political point about 
    parental responsibility!!!!!!!! <i>"I wanted to wake parents up to reality- 
    here's what happens if you hand your responsibility to some machine"</i></p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15533.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15533.html</a></p>
