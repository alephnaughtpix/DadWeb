<p>Some weird trojan horse has been spread by IRC!!!!! For some odd reason,
    once installed, it requests a file from the webserver of Geocities. Even
    wierder, the file no longer exists!!!!!!!! The trojan is apaprently based
    on Back Orifice (See <a href="7.html#196"> issue 7</a>...) , and could be used
    to control people's machines from afar!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15432.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15432.html</a></p>
