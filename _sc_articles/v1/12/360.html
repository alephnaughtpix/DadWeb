<p>Now this is a lofty ambition!!!! Some group of hackers want to start a new
    Internet!!! That's right, a whole new world-spanning computer network!!!!!
    In fact, you can tell it's a lofty ambition because the crew are called
    "<b>L0pht</b>"!!!!!!!!! It be interesting to see how this mighty idea
    works out, since the original Internet just started out with two US university
    computers linked together, and look at it now!!!!!! So good luck, l0pht!!!!!
