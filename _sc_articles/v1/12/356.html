<p>As we've noted before, there appears to be a little groundswell of nostalgia
    in Internet commentary these days!!!! (See 
    <a href="../story=273.html#"> issue story=273</a>...) But check
    this out!!!!! <i>"We are in the midst of a global revolution,"</i>
    apparently!!!! That's not all- apparently the Internet is going to change
    our lives, in loads of ways that we don't know yet!!!!!!!!! If the best
    that this "expert" can come up with is the sort of dross we saw in early
    issues of internet mags from Future Publishing, then I hardly think we're
    dealing with the pre-millenial Nostradamus of Internet trends here!!!!!!!!!
