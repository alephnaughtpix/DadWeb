<p>Well, you can already "do it" in a virtual stylee- and you don't even need
    a computer!!!!! You can wear this wonderful thing called a <b>"Nude suit"</b>!!!
    It's basically one of those PVC thingies, like those "dolls", except that
    you can step inside it and wear it!!!!! So you can put on clothes in order
    to go to a fancy dress party as a nude person!!!!!!!!! You might get stopped
    by the police a few times tho...</p><p><a href="http://www.nudesuit.com/">http://www.nudesuit.com/</a></p>
