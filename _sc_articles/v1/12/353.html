<p>What does Microsoft and Josef Mengeles have in common?!?!?!? Well, not
    much really- but the bods at MS are working on ways to "clone" copies
    of NT on different commputers across a network in order to make it
    easier to install stuff on a networked computer rather than installing
    it from a CD every time!!!! Presumably this is in response to the increased
    ease of installing Linux on computers, but we expect something similar
    to happen for Linux- if it hasn't happened already, and it's just not
    caught on yet!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19981006S0014">http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19981006S0014</a></p>
