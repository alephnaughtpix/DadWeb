<p>As Cliff Richard said in those 60s movies, <i>"Hey!!!!!!!!! Let's have a
    party!!!!!"</i> Only, instead of singing funny songs and dancing badly next
    to Una Stubbs, this lot in France are having a party on 10 October
    whilst installing Linux on their machines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And not just any
    old Linux either!!!!! It's apparently <i>"Linux comme Gimp, KDE, Gnome,
    Enlightenment, Wine, StarOffice,...."</i>, whatever that means!!!!! There's
    going to be groups all over France installing Linux and having a party at
    the same time!!! The group orgainising this is called AFUL (Which stands
    for <i>"Association Francophone des Utilisateurs de Linux et des logiciels
    libres"</i>, which means <i>"French-speaking Association of Linux and
    free software users"</i>), but we don't think they'll have an <i>"aful"</i> time on 10 October!!!!
