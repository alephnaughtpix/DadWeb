<p>Talking of <i>"bizzare"</i>- some people in Bolivia have found the footprints of
    a dinosaur- and they don't know what dinosaur it is!!!!!!! Shame the
    dinosaurs didn't didn't do a census and stuck it on the Internet!!!! It
    would have made things a lot more easier then!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/docs/056671.htm">http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/docs/056671.htm</a></p>
