<p>Anyone remember Minitel?!?! Some of you French readers might be going
    <i>"Yes!!!"</i>, or rather <i>"Ah oui!!!"</i> (Because you're French!!!),
    because it's the old(ish) French version of Prestel- on steroids!!!!
    Unfortunately because it's been so successful in France, they've been a bit
    slow to embrace the Internet!!!! So <i>"Big Blue"</i>, which is IBM, not a
    porno company as you may think (Didn't we do this joke before?!??!?!?!),
    is helping them upgrade it a bit!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/15439.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/15439.html</a></p>
