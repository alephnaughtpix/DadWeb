<p>Some of you might have noticed that dreadful purple abomination Barney the
    Dinosaur appearing in Dixons!!!!!! If you're old enough you might remember
    an even earlier example of evil robotic schmaltz-dispensing fluffy toys-
    Teddy Ruxpin!!!!!! Well, the makers of that thingy have come up with an
    even more nightmarish prospect!!!!! And it's got an even sillier name!!!!!
    It's called "<b>Furby</b>"!!!!!!!!!!! It's apparently got a really big
    vocabulary!!!! But only half of it in English!!!!! The other half of it
    is in the "thing's" own language, called <b>Furbish</b>, which it
    talks initially, and then slowly adds in the English phrases!!!! So now
    you're going to get a lot of kiddies talking in Furbish!!!!!!! It's
    irresponsible!!!!!! Ban it, I say!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15400.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15400.html</a></p>
