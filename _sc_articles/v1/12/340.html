<p>As you might know from <b>"Killer Net"</b>, you can get pictures of people
    "actually doing it"!!!!! In fact, according to <b>.net</b> magazine's
    completely made-up statistic quoted in the prog 95% of the people in the
    Internet are "doing it"!!!!!! (By which of course we mean searching for
    pictures of people "doing it", not actually "doing it" themselves!!!!!) But
    it turns out that those 95% might be better at actually "doing it" for
    real!!!! This is because, as someone said, "doing it" for real gets better
    with practice, and what better way of practising than "doing it" in virtual
    reality!??!?! Actually, I'm not sure this is a good idea!!!!! I saw some
    "late-night" movie on Sky on this subject recently, and there was this
    "cyberpunk" type dude who kept saying things like "Holy gigabyte!!!!!" This
    is not the sort of thing I'd like to see encouraged in young people!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15383.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15383.html</a></p>
