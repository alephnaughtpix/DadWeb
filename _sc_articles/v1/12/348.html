<p>You remember on that nice little TV prog <i>"Bugs"</i>, where they're always
    talking to each other on mobile phones!??!?! Well, that bit will get a bit
    more expensive to do on telly now, as the first mobile video-phones using a
    global standard of mobile communication or something like that, have been
    released!!!! According to this informtive little article the phone comes in
    two forms: One is like <i>"Captain Kirk's personal communicator"</i>, and
    the other is like <i>"ladies' makeup case with a touch-sensitive
    LCD screen"</i> !!!!!! I never knew ladies' makeup cases had tough sensitive
    LCD screens!!!!!!! Technology is really moving fast these days isn't it?!</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/template/Tec-Template.idc?artid=19981005194409290&amp;top=tec&amp;template=Default.htx&amp;maxfieldsize=1647">http://www.scmp.com/news/template/Tec-Template.idc?artid=19981005194409290‚ä§=tec<br/>
