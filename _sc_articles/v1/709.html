<p>For some unexplained reason, it's unofficial "MP3 Week" in Wired!!!!!!!!! 
    After all the usual hysteria along the lines of "MP3=piracy" or whatever, 
    they've done a whole load of stories about people doing good things with 
    the file format!!!!!!!!! They've of course mentioned the very nice people 
    at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a> who let loads of people upload their tunes to their servers, and then make CDs of them!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/story/18023.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/culture/<br/>
