<p>Imagine John Wayne going to the town Saloon after hard day's shooting guns and
    foiling cattle "rustlers"... He gets a "bourbon", and sits down in the
    "Internet Consoles" section of the bar to download some wholesome family
    photos!!! (Well, he's John Wayne, you wouldn't expect him to be downloading
    hardcore porn, would you?!?!?!?!?) Then as soon as he sits down in front of
    the compute, Phil Grant from Eastenders appeaars on the screen and goes:
    "Oi!!!!! John Wayne!!! You're barred!!!!!!!!!!!!!" John Wayne goes "Awww,
    sucks!!!!!!", and walks out of the saloon, a broken man!!!!!!!!</p><p>Sounds far-fetched?!?!? Well, you would be wrong!!!!! Because this week
    a cowboy was barred from the Internet!!!! A business "cowboy", that is!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.thestandard.net/articles/news_display/0,1270,1644,00.html">http://www.thestandard.net/articles/news_display/0,1270,1644,00.html</a></p>
