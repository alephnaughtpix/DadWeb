<p>The latest little toy on the SDWWWHQ Stealth Ninja AWACs web browsey-wowsey
    is this wierd thingie called <b>Zing!</b> Yes, I know it sounds like one of
    those Children's ITV progs from the 80s with Gaz Top on it, but it's actually
    a strange program which loads visuals and stuff while you're on the Internet,
    but not actually downloaing anything, and then when you click on a webpage,
    you get a bit of these visuals appearing whilst you're waiting for the page
    to download!!!! It's actually a pretty decent idea, but we think the content
    will have to get better before it really catches on!!!! There are numerous
    "channels" which "broadcast" about 15 secs of Shockwave Flash animation, one
    of them is a "famous quotes" chan, another is a "Learn French" spot, and then
    there's one devoted to music "clips" from various bands reviewed in a US
    magazine called "Rolling Stone", who appear to be devoted to exactly the same
    sort of bands covered in that book I did last year called <i>"First Against
    the Wall When the Revolution Comes: A Guide to Who's Who In Dull-But-Worthy
    Music"</i>!!!!</p><p>Once they get more exciting stuff on their "channels", and, even better, allow
    users to make their own content, then they'll really be laughing!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zing.com/">http://www.zing.com/</a></p><p>The very first thing we saw from Zing!!!!!
