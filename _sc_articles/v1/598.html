<p>So what have the 
    NSA got to say for themselves?!?!? Erm, not much really, but they have 
    released this little paper, which argues that it's impossible to secure 
    anything completely!!!!!! But, er, they're the NSA, aren't they!?!?!? 
    They spy on everyone, and break loads of security and so on, so they 
    *<b>would</b>* say that you can't secure anything completely, wouldn't 
    they?!?! Because they always keep breaking in!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.jya.com/paperF1.htm">http://www.jya.com/paperF1.htm</a></p>
