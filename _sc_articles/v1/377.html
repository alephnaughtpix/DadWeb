<p>If you're getting annoyed by those little banner ads that crop up on webpages... Well, 
    bully for you, Mr Stalin!!!!! I happen to think they're really great, 
    and if one or two start appearing on my pages, and I get some money/audience 
    then it's be really brilliant!!!!! Erm, anyway, if you're annoyed, then 
    you're going to be even more annoyed by this development- ad banners 
    with sound!!! Hmmmm.... <i>(Imagines a "Senior Citizen" ad banner with 
    the words "IT ROX- DADDIO!!!" booming out of the speakers in 45bit 6452Kzh 
    sound!!!!)</i>
