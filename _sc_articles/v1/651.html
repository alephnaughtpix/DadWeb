<p>What will you be doing on April 1, 2001?!?!?! Will you be trading jolly japes en route 
    to a big space station whilst playing "The Blue Danube" on an MP3 walkman!?!?!?! 
    Or maybe you'll be on a ship going to Jupiter, and playing April Fool 
    jokes on a really intelligent computer, who will later kill you dead!!!!!!! 
    But according to this article, what you'll actually be doing on April 
    1 2001 is fixing the clock on your Wintel box, if you have one!!!!! 
    That's because the fact that April 1 on 2001 falls on a Saturday confuses 
    one of the DLL files in Windows, and it forgets about putting the clocks 
    forward on that day, and only sets things right a week later!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/printer_friendly/0,5444,2186402,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/printer_friendly/0,5444,2186402,00.html</a></p>
