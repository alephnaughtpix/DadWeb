<p>Have you ever saw one of theose really boring "arts" shows on late at night,
    and thought: <i>"This art's show's really boring!!!!!!!!! Wouldn't it be great
    if someone crossed it with 'Gladiators'?!?!??!"?!?!??!??! Well, that's what
    someone's done in Japan!!!!!!!!!!! In <i>"Takeshi no Daredemo Pikaso"
    (Takeshi's Anyone Can Be Picasso)</i> there's a section called "Art
    Battle"!!!!! Presumably the competitors have to draw something on a pad, and
    then hit the other person over the head with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that's
    how I'd do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i></p><p><a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0204cu36.htm">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0204cu36.htm</a></p>
