<p>Wow!!!!! This Lisa Scot always seems to be falling off chairs laughing if this website
    is anything to go by!!!!!!! Which is quite funny seeing as she writes about murder and
    crime!!!!! Yes, she's a crime writer- and she wants *<b>you</b>* to edit her stuff for
    her!!!! Yeppo!!!!! There's an "interactive editor" bit in her website!!!!! Sounds a bit
    lazy if you ask me!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.scottoline.com/newedit.cfm">http://www.scottoline.com/newedit.cfm</a></p>
