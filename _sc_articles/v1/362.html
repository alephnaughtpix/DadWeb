<p>Remember that classic landmark popular music videogram from the 1980s by Cliff Richard 
    called "Wired For Sound"??!?!?! For all you young people, it was a jolly 
    little song about listening to one's walkman!!! And the video was full 
    of really "hip" people on roller-skates listening to their walkmans!!! 
    Because listening to walkmans were really hip in the 1980s!!!! Well, 
    I wonder how the 90s equivalent of Cliff Richard (eg that young man 
    out of popular beat group Oasis- at least he can sing, eh Chris Evans?!?!) 
    would approach the 90s equivalent here!!!!! Some combo called Saehan 
    Information systems have done a walkman- for MP3 files!!!!!! You can 
    upload loadsa MP3 files from your compute to this thingy, and you have 
    a portable MP3 walkman, and you can put on your roller skates and look 
    really hip like in the 80s!!!!!! I can imagine the sort of songs Noddy 
    Gallagher from Oasis is probably thinking up like: <i>"Shaker MP3er", 
    "Do you know what I MP3?" "You Gotta Roll with MP3", "Don't MP3 Back 
    In Anger",</i> and Erm...!! I've run out of ideas!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mpman.com">http://www.mpman.com</a>
<p>If you're a Unix person, you can use this proggy to upload your 
    files to the thingy.... </p>

<p>But they'd better be quick, because <b>Samsung</b> is on the case!!!!! 
    According to this story from the Korean Times, Samsung, are bringing 
    out their own MP3 player!!! When a name like Samsung enters the market, 
    they must be taking it seriously!!!!</p>

<p>Samsung might run into a bit of a legal clash with the American 
    record company moguls, who have already managed to delay one MP3 walkman. 
    But check this one out!!!! A UK company is planning to release an 
    MP3 player, which is actually a little PC running Linux!!!!! Because 
    it's a PC, it might skirt round the legal probs!!!! And since it's 
    Linux, you can probably connect it to the Internet, and run a webserver 
    from it to tell people what you're playing!!!!!!</p>
