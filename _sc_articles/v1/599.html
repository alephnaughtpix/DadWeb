<p>You've probably 
    seen those poster ads for Jack Daniels... You know, the one where they 
    take some piddling little part of the place where they make the stuff, 
    and go on and on about it, like they're National Geographic or something!!!!!!!! 
    Well, after this week, maybe they should do an ad with some Linux proppelor-head 
    nerd geek young fellow on his compute, and write below it:</p><blockquote>
<p>"THEY give <b>Billy-Ray Jim Bob</b> a special name around these parts: 
        they call him 'HackMaster of The Lethal Phreaker Crew'.</p>
<p>He's spent years 
        learning how to hack into any sort of system you can imagine. That's why 
        he's now hacking into the Jack Daniel's website.</p>
<p>He may spend days on his 
        computer, but, as they say around town, 'insert trite proverb here'."</p>
</blockquote><p>Yes, that's right, someone hacked the Jack Daniels website!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.hackernews.com/archive/jackdan98/jack.html">http://www.hackernews.com/archive/jackdan98/jack.html</a></p>
