<p>Yes, it's true!!!!!!!!! MS reads the haven of propeller-head Linux geek nerds!!!!!!!! At
    least according to this memo leaked from MS-land on 31 Oct!!!!!! Hence the title "The
    Halloween Memo"!!!! This "memo" is about all that open source stuff, and what MS can
    do about it- and the answer appears to be "take over the Internet" and do really
    really complex software that no sane person would be able to emulates!!!!!!!! The only thing
    is... Linux Geeks are already way ahead of MS on that score!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html</a></p><p>When this info was posted on Slashdot on Saturday, the amount of responses to it caused
    a system overload!!!</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/98/11/02/1120257.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/98/11/02/1120257.shtml</a></p><p>Quite a few people on Slashdot wondered if this maybe a little hoax!!!!!! Well, it was
    confirmed by MS on Tuesday both in the print pages of the Wall Street Journal, and also on this
    story on news.com!!! Oddly enough, this is the only the first news story we've actually seen
    outside of Slashdot-land!!!!!! We didn't get a peep from ZD-Net or Wired when this first
    broke!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28215,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28215,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a>
<p>But there's more!!!!! There's now a "Halloween II" document!!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween2.html">http://www.opensource.org/halloween2.html</a></p>
<p>Amazingly enough, Wired News have actually bothered to cover it now that the second
    doc is out!!!!!!! This report includes the really funny quote from Linux Torvalds about the
    memo: <i>"It's fairly mild, and I got the feeling that the person that wrote it actually
    liked Linux, but maybe I'm on drugs."!!!!!</i></p>
