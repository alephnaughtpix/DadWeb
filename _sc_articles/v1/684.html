title: "Network Card has 'gigabits'!!!!!"
issue: 24
---
<p>Well, as you might 
    know, SDHQ is currently in the throes of adding a network between our 
    two PC computers, <b>Andrew Ridgely</b> (The Windowsy one!!!!) and <b>Godzilla</b>!!!! 
    (The Linuxy one!!!) Well, it's extremely tough work to get the flippin' 
    thing working, but by the time I do get it going "on the ball" (As they 
    say, in the business!!!!!!!!!) I'll be able to upgrade it to this super-duper 
    network type thing, which can apparently shift "gigabits" of data!!!!!!!!! 
    (What, like whole pictures or something?!?!?!??!) Only problem is, I 
    can't immediately see exactly what I'd be able to do with my computers 
    in order to generate gigabits of data in order to be able to shift it 
    around this network!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless I was to broadcast the details 
    of every lavatory flush from my house on tha NetWeb like that young 
    man from Holland!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="23.html#673"> issue 23</a>...)</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/990203/wa_packet__1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/990203/wa_packet__1.html</a></p>
