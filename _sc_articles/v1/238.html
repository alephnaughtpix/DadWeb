<p>First there was <b>Hollywood Babylon</b>, a book by <b>Kenneth Anger</b> on
    Hollywood scandals!!! Then there was <b>Rock 'n' Rock Babylon</b>, a book by
    Kenneth Anger on rock 'n' rock scandals!!!! Now there's <b>Linux Babylon</b>,
    which, erm, rather disappointingly is not a book by Kenneth Anger on scandal
    in the Slashdot crowd, but a new linux-based game platform thingy which is
    supposed to be geared towards making games programming easy and so on...
    Apparently you just boot this "Babylon" system up, and then run the game on
    top of it!!! It uses all the usual Linux library type stuff like Glide,
    SVGAlib, MEDlib, etc., ... It's in an early stage, but it's an interesting
    idea!!</p><p>We can't really see any established games companies actually taking it
    up to be honest, but it might be really popular with the free-software
    types, and indeed "bedroom" programmers who are getting increasingly shut out
    of the games business by proprietary standards!!!!! (Ooooh!!! Aren't we being
    political this week!!!!) The people behind this hope to port to it other
    UNIX "flavours", which would make porting games to other hardware platforms
    pretty easy!!!</p><p><a href="http://celsius-software.hypermart.net/babylon/">http://celsius-software.hypermart.net/babylon/</a></p>
