<p>Now you might have seen those funny "adult" films they show late at night
    on Sky Premier Ultra Box Office Gold 3, or whatever they call their channels
    these days!!!! What you may not know is that you might be looking at the
    future of cinema!!! That's because this week, a film is going to be
    distributed by satellite!!!!! Instead, presumably, of posting it or whatever
    they do...
