<p>Well, these guys certainly know how to "Fight the Power"!!!!! Only a month or two after 
    they posted their entire "Bring the Noise 2000" album online in MP3 
    format just to annoy their record company, and then took it off after 
    their record company got annoyed enough to get heavy with the lawyer 
    people, they've now posted a new song, "Swindlers Lust"- in *<b>MP4</b>* 
    format!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html">http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html</a></p><p>But what's MP4!?!?! Is it the latest form of MPEG file?!?!?! In 
    fact, no it isn't!!!!! It's just some company's proprietary format 
    which they just happen to call "MP4", which by an odd coincidence 
    just happens to sound exactly like what you would expect to call an 
    MPEG-1 Layer 4 file, or an MPEG-4 file!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html</a></p><p>But that's not all!!!!!!!!!! A lot of people on Slashdot have noticed 
    that PE's tune only available as Windows only executable file and 
    are kicking up a bit of a fuss about it!!!!!!!! The executable apparently 
    includes a player, but it's ironic that PE are slagging off commercialism 
    in such a prinicipled fashion, whilst supporting the world's biggest 
    software company and using a proprietary format!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml</a></p><p>But the player wasn't the only executable!!!!!!!! At the time of 
    writing (11/1/99), the website posted this warning:</p><blockquote>
    If you downloaded Swindler's Lust MP4 today (1/7) between 3 p.m.and 
    5:15 p.m. EST, it may be infected with a virus. A new copy has been 
    uploaded. P.E. apologizes for the oversight.
  </blockquote><p>Woops!!!!!! Luckily, some compiled an MP3 version of the file!!!!!!!! 
    And the Public Enemy website people have also put it on their website, 
    which now means PE are now supporting a cross-platform non-proprietary 
    format!!!!!!! So it's ended up all right in the end anyway!!!!!!!
