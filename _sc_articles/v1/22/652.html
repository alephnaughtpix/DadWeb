<p>If I said "synthetic DNA", what would you think about?!?!?! If you thought of the dance music 
    group who remixed Suzanne Vega, you'd be wrong!!!!!!!! I am in fact 
    talking about the synthetic form of one of the fundamental building 
    blocks of life!!!!!! And these clever dudes have made a tiny little 
    robot "arm" from it, and expect this to be the practical base from which 
    to start on nanomachines!!!!!!!! Bet when you last looked at your DNA, 
    you never thought that you'd be seeing the basis of a very small version 
    of the Cybermen!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254498.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254498.stm</a></p>
