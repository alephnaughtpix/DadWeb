<p>According to this article, you'd need to have a bit of a "Deathwish" to hack on tha inphopipeway 
    today!!!!!! Apparently there's a lot of "cyber vigilantes" that are 
    annoyed enough with hacker's exploits, that they go and do the same 
    things some naughty hackers do!!!!! Except that they're supposed to 
    be on the side of the law!!!!!!!! Which is a tad hyprocritical if you 
    ask me!!!!!!!!</p><p>Mind you, some of these people seem to be as dim as a post, and 
    as subtle as a Michael Winner movie!!! One person who calls himself 
    "Lou Cipher" says: <i>"We have actually gotten on a plane and visited 
    the physical location where the attacks began. We've broken in, stolen 
    the computers and left a note: 'See how it feels?' "</i> Yep, sounds 
    a very cost effective and legally watertight method to us!!!!!! Now 
    we know what to do if some Norwegian hacks our site!!!!!!!! We'll 
    just get on the plane to Norway, break into a complete strangers office, 
    and steal their computers!!!!! If anything goes wrong and we get caught, 
    we'll just explain to the Norwegian authorities that it was all Louie 
    Ciphers' idea really!!!!! I'm sure they'll understand, even tho they'll 
    probably have trouble finding "Lou Cipher", because that's actually 
    a pseudonym he's adopted for some strange reason!!!!!!</p><p>But it gets better!!!! Mr Cipher says that one time <i>"We had to 
    resort to baseball bats. That's what these punks will understand. 
    Then word gets around, and we're left alone. That's all we want, to 
    be left alone."</i> Which of course explains why all the loners we 
    know of carry baseball bats, doesn't it?!?!??!! Some of you older 
    readers might remember that this story sounds oddly familiar- in fact 
    we covered a similar online-inspired baseball bat showdown in our 
    very first issue!!!!! (See <a href="1.html#4"> issue 1</a>...) OK, 
    it wasn't about hacking, but then again, everyone knows that all hackers 
    deserve to get beaten around the head with baseball bats, don't they?!?! 
    Mind you, it wouldn't be so good for the computer security industry, 
    which is stuffed with ex-hackers, and is, oddly enough, Lou Cipher's 
    line of work...</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/12/cybervigilantes.idg/">http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/12/cybervigilantes.idg/</a></p><p>Understandably real-life hackers are finding this story really quite 
    funny!!!!!! <b>Hacker News Network (HNN)</b> says it's a load of FUD 
    rubbish!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.hackernews.com/archive.html?011399.html">http://www.hackernews.com/archive.html?011399.html</a></p>
