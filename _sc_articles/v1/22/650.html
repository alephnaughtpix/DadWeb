<p>Well, we've mentioned in the past about the Republic of Ireland apparently set to become a 
    major centre of e-commerce, (See <a href="17.html#520"> issue 17</a>...) 
    but what do you need for secure e-commerce!?!??! That's right, a decent 
    encryption algorithm!!!!! So luckily for the republic, some really smart 
    16 year old girl has invented some spiffy new type of encryption called 
    <b>Cayley-Purser</b> encryption!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254236.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254236.stm</a></p><p>Mind you, the Slashdot people are a little cynical!!!! I wonder 
    why!!!! Perhaps it's because the story looks a little similar to another 
    "young boffin invents spiffy encryption technique" type story from 
    the BBC News website!!!!!! (See <a href="6.html#169"> issue 6</a>...)</p><p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/01/13/0931237&amp;pid=0#17">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/01/13/0931237&amp;pid=0#17</a></p>
