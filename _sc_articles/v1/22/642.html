<p>But one place an MP3 recorder <i>wouldn't</i> be welcome is in a building run by the 
    American National Security Agency!!!! (NSA) They ban all recording thingies 
    in case it's a Russian spy taping secrets about the hydrogen bomb or 
    something!!!!!!!!! So guess what they did with Furbies, which can record 
    sounds and replay them?!?!?! Yep, that's right, they've banned them 
    as well!!!!! So what you may think, but the media have went absoltuely 
    crazy about the flippin' thing!!!!!!!! CNN even give us a helpful description 
    in case we want to report them to the authorities!!!!! <i>"Furby resembles 
    an owl, with tufts of hair between its huge pink ears."!!!!!!!</i> One 
    wonders if the NSA are doing this to appear "hip" and "crazy" and not 
    at all like an ominous massively secretive "Big Brother" type grouping!!!!!!! 
    I wonder if the Konformist mailing list (See <a href="20.html#592"> 
    issue 20</a>...) is going to go on about this?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01/">http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01/</a></p>
