<p>I bet when you saw all those cartoons of Pluto when you were young, that you didn't 
    think "Astronomers will be arguing if he's a planet in the future!!!!!" 
    But that's what's happened!!!!!!! Of course, they aren't really talking 
    about the famous Disney cartoon character!!!!!! They're actually talking 
    about a flying piece of rock that was named after the dog by an American 
    astronomer called Clyde Tombaugh!!!!! (Who ironically, was himself named 
    after a famous paddle steamer on the River Clyde which went to the Mull 
    of Kintyre, which is where Paul McCartney got the idea for his song!!!!!!!! 
    So if you ever wanted to know what the connection is between Paul McCartney 
    and a piece of flying rock millions of miles away, now you know!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
    Erm, anyway!!!! When it was discovered, it was thought Pluto was the 
    ninth planet in the Solar System, but it looked a bit small for a planet!!!!!!! 
    Then, astronomers found an area not so far way called the "<b>Kuiper 
    Belt</b>", (Named of course after Agent Cooper in "Twin Peaks"!!!!) 
    which has around 60 Pluto-sized asteroids!!!!! So it looks as though 
    Pluto is really just a big asteroid originating from that area, and 
    is not really a planet at all!!!!! (Which astronomers always expected 
    to be a bit more massive than Pluto appeared to be- because of gravity 
    or something really smart like that!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=000647321007942&amp;rtmo=Q3wQpx3R&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;P4_FOLLOW_ON=/99/1/18/nplu18.html&amp;pg=/et/99/1/18/nplu18.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=000647321007942&amp;rtmo=Q3wQpx3R<br/>
