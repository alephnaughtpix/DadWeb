<p>Have you ever travelled near the speed of light and thought: <i>"This sort of thing 
    isn't representated very well by modern raytracing programs!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?!?!!? 
    Well, if so, you'll like this new raytracer!!!!! <b>Backlight</b> raytraces 
    using the laws of Relativity to measure the effect on light, which affects 
    the final picture!!!!!!!! So, if Einstien wanted to use a raytracer, 
    he might use this one!!!!!!!!!!! So, it's a bit of shame that he's dead 
    now, isn't it?!??!?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/Searle/">http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/Searle/</a></p>
