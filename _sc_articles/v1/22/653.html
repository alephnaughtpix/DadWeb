<p>As you might have heard recently, (See <a href="20.html#602"> issue 20</a>...) some clever 
    boffins are working towards the first "photon" chip!!!!! But it's a 
    hard job getting all the bits of optical plastic together... Wouldn't 
    it be really cool if the plastic could put itself together, all by itself!??!!? 
    Well, that's what these clever people are working on!!!!!!!! No, they're 
    not plastic molecules themselves, silly!!!!!! They're telling the plastic 
    molecules how to put themselves together, and they do it, just like 
    a grown up!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/plastics990115.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/plastics990115.html</a></p>
