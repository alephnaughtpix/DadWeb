<p>Well, you know about us and drugs!!!!!!!! The only time we use "hash" is during FTP 
    transfers!!!!!! By which we are of course referring to the use of the 
    command "hash" in an FTP session in order to toggle the display of "#" 
    characters per block of FTP transfer!!!!!!!!!!! But this lot are different!!!!! 
    Delegates at some conference called <b>"Digital Be-In"</b> are wishing 
    to acknowledge the importance of drug-taking in the computing industry!!!!! 
    <i>I feel good about who I am, and I wouldn't be who I am without LSD!"</i> 
    said one person.</p><p>So... Apparently a lot of the software and hardware we're used to 
    today was written by people on drugs!!!!!!!! And this is supposed 
    to be news to us!?!?!?!?!??!
