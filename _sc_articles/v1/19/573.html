<p>Hopefully this 
    flipping hype about portals is finally beginning to die down a bit now!!!! 
    Last week, we told about an 11 year-old running her own portal, (See 
    <a href="18.html#549"> issue 18</a>...) now we have this survey that 
    says that people tend to use portals for reading the news!!!! Given 
    that the news sections tend to be just an add-on to the average portal, 
    that tells you quite a lot!!!!!!!!! But not that much of it has apparently 
    got through to the people who wrote this press release!!!!! By their 
    arguments, this esteemed organ must be a portal as well!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/jupiter_co_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/jupiter_co_1.html</a></p><p>The latest issue of the really very good <b>Ghost sites</b> newsletter 
    predicts that if it's still around next year, it'll be covering loadsa 
    portal sites!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/gs981208.htm">http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/gs981208.htm</a></p>
