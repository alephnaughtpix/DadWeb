<p>How often have 
    you thought: <i>"This CD I'm listening to is a load of shit!!!!!! I 
    could do better than them!!!!"</i> I know I have!!!! Well, apparently 
    now you can do better- by making your own CD!!!!! And this helpful little 
    article will tell you how to do it!!!!! (Erm, actually you really need 
    a CD writer to make a CD!!!!! So don't try making it without a CD writer!!!!!! 
    Unless you're really silly!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/136.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/136.html</a></p>
