<p>Well, now that 
    the old singer (Who I'm sure does not really sound like Big Poo Generator!!!!!) 
    has kicked the bucket, the FBI have released all their wads of paperwork 
    on the ex-singer!!!!!! Now, the former "pipes" man might have wowed 
    people the world over with his "doobedoobedoo" technique on "Strangers 
    in the Night", but he doesn't seem to have been too friendly with the 
    Feds!!!! One of the "reports" on him even offers the opinion that he 
    would have been a 'hoodlum' if he wasn't so 'cowardly'!!!!!!! This Edgar 
    Hoover person who was running the FBI at the time (Long before Scully 
    and Mulder!!!) seems to be a really "sore" person!!!! Mind you, it must 
    be difficult being the son of the man who invented the vacuum cleaner!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/apb_online_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/apb_online_1.html</a></p>
