<p>If you've ever been to a really big church, did you ever think:
    "Aha!!!! This is exactly like Microsoft, and any major record
    label!!!"?!?!?!? And after that, did you go to some car boot sale
    and thought: "Aha!!! Linux!!! And Cliff Richard in the future!!!!"
    Well, perhaps you ought to next time!!!!!! Because apparently
    you've just been watching the future of development models in
    software and popular music!!!!!</p><p>Some open source dude wrote this bloody long essay called <i>"The 
    Cathedral and the Bazzar"</i> in which "big" software companies are 
    apparently cathedrals and open source stuff is a bazzar!!!!!! Well, 
    now another person has written another essay on how it's going to 
    be generally the same for popular music!!!! Which is just as well, 
    since we recently sent a demo of our <a href="../../../music">music</a> 
    to a certain major record company, and they wrote back, calling us 
    laughable!!!! (Presumably because we weren't a "hip" Britpop act with 
    "attitude" and "swagger"!!!!!) Well, they said that about the Beatles!!!!! 
    Well, OK, not exactly, but you know what I mean!!!!!!!!</p><p>In any case, if this essay is to be belived, music is going get 
    more "bazzar"!!!!!!!!!! (DOH!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/142.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/142.html</a></p>
