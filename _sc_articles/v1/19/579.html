<p>What do you mean 
    you're sick of the Star Wars trailer already?!?!? Well, you have to 
    "unsick" yourselves!!!! If you're going to the cinema this Xmas, you're 
    probably going to be seeing it again!!!! It's going to appear in selected 
    UCI movie theatres from Dec 16!!! If you're going to a UCI cinema to 
    the see "<b>The Mask Of Zorro</b>", and you wonder why the queues to 
    get in are so incredibly long, then now you know!!!!!!</p><p>You can spend the long hours waiting until that happens by downloading 
    "augmented" versions of the trailer from this helpful little site, 
    which includes mirrors to loadsa trailers as well as loads of "unusual" 
    versions, such as the "camcorder" one, and a "stereo pro-logic" version!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://countingdown.com/starwars/mirrorlist.htm">http://countingdown.com/starwars/mirrorlist.htm</a></p>
