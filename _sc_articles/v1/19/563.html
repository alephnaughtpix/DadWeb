<p>Some of you might have heard about some enterprising young
    ruffians using those funny TV remote control replacement thingies,
    which record the infrared codes zapped out by your old remote
    control, to record the infrared codes used by some car locking
    systems, and unlock them- without a key!!!! Well, some years after
    that, the lovely little Palm Pilot now sports a similar infrared
    "recording" facility for TV users- and guess what!!!! Young
    ruffians are using it to break into cars as well!!!!!</p><p>Well I never!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981210/technology/technology/1998121001.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981210/technology/technology/1998121001.html</a></p>
