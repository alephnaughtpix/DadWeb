<p>Well, if like me, you're almost surfing with an American accent,
    then you'll like this one!!!! It's a TV site- but it's actually for
    European telly, not American stuff!!!!!!!!! Not only that, but it's
    apparently one of the top 10 sites in Belgium!!!! I dunno why they
    class "Can't Cook, Won't Cook" as an "emission" tho...</p><p><a href="http://www.eurotv.com/">http://www.eurotv.com/</a></p>
