<p>I suppose you're 
    waiting for me to say something like "Well, now I've got your attention, 
    here's the real story!!!!" or something crap like that!!!!! Well, I'm 
    not going to do that!!!! I really am going to talk about the relationship 
    between Beavis (out of "Beavis &amp; Butthead") and Elvis Presley!!!!</p><p>OK, here goes... Beavis is in "Beavis &amp; Butthead", which was created 
    by Mike Judge. He appeared in the movie "Airheads" who also starred 
    Nina Siemaszko. She appeared in the move "The Long Way Home", which 
    also starred Ed Asner. And Ed Asner appeared in "Change of Habit", 
    with... (drum roll!!!) Elvis Presley!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Yes, it's that type of website!!!! In the "<b>Oracle of Elvis</b>" 
    website, you can type in any old name, and find out their connection 
    to "Mr Rock 'n' Roll Cheeseburger"!!!! Unfortunately, when I tried 
    to find out my connection to the very talented movie actor, it didn't 
    work!!!!! I'll have to email them to remind them that I of course 
    shouted "That Colonel Tom Parker will be the death of you!!!" at him 
    when I was a baggage attendant at Prestwick airport, which was coincidentelly 
    the scene of Presley's only UK "gig"!!!! He said something like "Sort 
    it out!!!", which I took to be an offer to be his new manager!!!!! 
    At which point some big bloke ran towards me looking a little angry, 
    then I saw a lot of stars, and when I woke up, Elvis had left the 
    building!!!!!!</p><p>Incidentelly, if you've been watching the very nice cable channel 
    "Cartoon Network", you might have noticed that one of their adverts 
    uses a similar "connections" game- only it's not with Elvis, it's 
    with Thelma out of Scooby Doo!!!!! We wonder how long it's going to 
    be before their website does an "Oracle of Thelma"?!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~acs5d/oracle.html">http://www.people.virginia.edu/~acs5d/oracle.html</a></p>
