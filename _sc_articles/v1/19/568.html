<p>Well, after all 
    that, you may be not too surprised by this story!!! Apparently according 
    to this survey, 40% of kids have seen something "rude" on the net!!!! 
    (As opposed to Channel 5, presumably!!!!!) And that's not all!!!!! One 
    in seven saw pages that "freightened them"!!!!!!!!! Now this is something 
    I've never heard of!!!! Children being turned into freight containers!!!!!! 
    A seventh of all kids going up and down the country transporting corporate 
    goods because they saw something on the net!!!!!!! Surely this netweb 
    thingy is dangerous and ought to be banned!!!!!!! (Apart from us of 
    course!!!!! And, erm, the internet, because we, like, report on it, 
    don't we?!??!?!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29161,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29161,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a></p>
