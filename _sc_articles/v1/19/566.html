<p>Some of you might 
      dimly remember the advert for the musical band <b>Big Poo Generator</b>... 
      (See <a href="14.html#430"> issue 14</a>...) Well, <b>Hemorrhoy Rogers</b> 
      of that very band actually read this very organ, (Fnarr fnarr!!!!!!) 
      and emailed us to request that we write something bad about the band!!!! 
      <i>"It would really help us out if you would say that we suck or something 
      like that."</i> (Especially if quoted in press releases, we imagine!!!!) 
      So here goes!!!!</p><pre class="usenet">I was innocently led to believe from their advert 
that the oddly named <b>BIG POO GENERATOR</b> were similar
in style to Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones!!!! Imagine my 
shock and horror when I visited their disgusting website, 
and found that they were the audio equivalent of South 
Park, without even it's redeeming features!!!! Crudeness
and an obsession with bodily functions seem to be all 
these young ruffians can think about- does the average 
normal God-fearing person in the street really wish to 
know about the singer's half brother's digusting illness,
or that "Mr Poo" is "in you"!??! To mention these 
obscenities in the same breath as Frank Sinatra is not
only inaccurate- it's a moral crime against humanity!!! 
It should be Big Poo Generator in the courts rather than
General Pinochet!!!! (Mind you, gas masks might be 
mandatory for the jurors!!!!!!)</pre><p>Right- is that good enough!??!?!?! I should really listen to your 
      music sometime, Rogers!!!! Just wait till I upgrade my modem from 
      the 300 baud model I have at the mo...</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~lobstar">http://home.earthlink.net/~lobstar</a></p>
