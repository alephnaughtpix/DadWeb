<p>You now, sometimes news is like a snowball!!!!!!! An obvious example of this happened this 
    week, when someone put up a web page of his experiences in trying to 
    get money from Microsoft!!!!! He'd bought a little PC computer, and 
    they had pre-loaded Windows on it... But he didn't want the PC for Windows, 
    as he was going to put Linux on it!!!!!!!!! So he asked for a refund 
    on the software!!!!! Apparently that microscopic text with that licence 
    thingy you get with Windows says that you can get a refund!!!!!!!! He 
    had a bit of trouble actually getting the money from them tho!!!!! But 
    when he eventually got it, he detailed all his experiences on a webpage 
    for all to read!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.netcraft.com.au/geoffrey/toshiba.html">http://www.netcraft.com.au/geoffrey/toshiba.html</a></p><p>Then someone told Slashdot about it!!!!!!!! And there was a lot of discussion!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/18/1539214.shtml">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/18/1539214.shtml</a></p><p>The resulting publicity inspired this interesting little website 
    which is organising a mass "refund" day!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.thenoodle.com/refund/">http://www.thenoodle.com/refund/</a></p>
