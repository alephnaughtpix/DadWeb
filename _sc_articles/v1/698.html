<p>We saw this interesting news story from MSNBC!!!!!!!! (You know, the lot who
    do that that really uninteresting telly channel with that Conan O'Brien, who
    manages to be even less funny than David Letterman!!!!!!!) They say: <i>"Most
    software vendors would love a little attention from Microsoft
    Corp."</i>!!!!!!!!! Well, apparently the dudes who do <b>BeOS</b> don't!!!!!!!
    In fact, they're asking Microsoft to stop using them as evidence of
    "competitors" in their statements in the US courts!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/238722.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/238722.asp</a></p>
