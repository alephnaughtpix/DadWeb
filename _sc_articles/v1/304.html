<p>Well, you might not be terribly impressed by "South Park", but watch out,
    it's going to get even worse, as they're going to "Do The Bartman" by
    releasing a novelty single, which will probably go to No. 1 for zillions of
    weeks!!!! It's by "Master P" and it's a "rap" called, wait for it, "Kenny's
    Dead"!!!! Ho ho. Even worse it's the "flagship" single from a whole "South
    Park" album!!!! It's probably going to be even more embarrasing than "The
    Simpsons Sing The Blues"!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/southpark/album/">http://www.comedycentral.com/southpark/album/</a></p>
