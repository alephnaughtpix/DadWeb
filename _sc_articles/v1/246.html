<p><b>Negativland</b>, a bunch of dudes who make records out of sampling
    everyone else, are not too pleased at the moment!!!!! Apparently their
    CD plant won't press their latest album, and won't tell them why!!!!
    The dudes at Negativland HQ, who have already slagged off the record
    industry a few times in various articles for fanzines and websites,
    say that record companies have put pressure on the CD plant because
    of all the naughty sampling on their album!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14765.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14765.html</a></p>
