<p>Well,as you might know, <b>Slashdot</b> is a really good place for finding pointers to 
    the latest news!!!!! But occasionally, they can slip up!!!! Like for 
    example in this case, when they posted a "joke" news item about someone 
    dying without saying it was a joke item!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://mandrake.net/1825258.html">http://mandrake.net/1825258.html</a></p><p>After the furore, the "joke" piece was amended to say that it was really a clever 
    ruse to expose "problems with Slashdot's editorial policies"!!!</p>
