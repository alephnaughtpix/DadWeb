      Lately I have been having an excessive amount of gas when I wake up in the morning,is there any way to use this to my
      advantage?</li>

      Yes there sure is ! Attach one end of a garden hose to your rear end,then attach the other end to your coffee maker and
      toaster.When you wake in the morning your breakfast will be cooked for you !</li>
