<p>Well, no doubt you'll be aware that there's a lot of people saying that
    many people have already left it too late to defend themselves against the
    Millenium Bug, but if you want to *<i>really</i>* leave it to the last moment,
    here's an idea... Wait till just before midday on 31st December 1999, and
    get a satellite link to Fiji!!! Because it's just off the International
    Date Line, it's 12 hours ahead of GMT time, so the Y2K probs will hit there
    first!!! People in Fiji are making some money from this by advertising itself
    as the advance warning station for the rest of the world!!!! Only prob- what
    if the communications equipment there is not Y2K compatible!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/br/eaking/docs/059681.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/br/eaking/docs/059681.htm</a></p>
