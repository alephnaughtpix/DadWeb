<p>Well, this is surprising!!!! Apparently someone's done a big and expensive
    study in the US and found out that people spend all their time in front of
    the computer are more likely to be lonely!!!!!! And because of that they're
    less likely to be happy!!!! So in summary- heavy internet users are sad
    lonely geeks!!! Apparently the people who put 1.5 million dollars to find
    out this shock finding are a bit cheesed off as they thought the survey
    would say the exact opposite!!!!! But the people that got the money to do
    the survey (Called "HomeNet"- tells you quite a lot, doesn't it?!?!?) must
    be laughing!!!!</p><p>Be careful- apparently clicking this link may make you ONE PER-CENT
      MORE DEPRESSED and 0.4 PER-CENT MORE LONELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://spyglass1.sjmercury.com/br/eaking/docs/041297.htm">http://spyglass1.sjmercury.com/br/eaking/docs/041297.htm</a></p><p>Mind you, the average survey margin of error is usually a bit more
      than 1 per-cent, so it might go either way!!!</p>
