<p>Well, he's been getting famous, and lots of people have been writing
    about him, so it was only a matter of time before there was a
    massive backlash!!!!! I'm of course talking about <b>Harry Knowles</b>
    and his movie rumours website <b>Ain't It Cool News</b>!!!! There was
    some rumblings over the news about Peter Jackson and the Lord of the
    Rings trilogy and Harry's enthusiastic reaction (Isn't he always
    enthusiastic!??!?!) and then the news that Peter Jackson was going to
    answer readers questions about the films on the site... Then his
    week his site went one movie rumour too far and posted some rumours
    seen in the UK movie free mag "Flicks" to the effect that the Star
    Wars movie had been delayed!!! As many people suspected, this was
    a crap mag just retelling an old rumour, but in the talkback section
    accompanying the article turned into a complete slag-off of the whole
    site, with loads of people going right ahead and calling a Harry "full
    of shit" and a "sellout"!!! Not that they're jealous of the site or
    Harry's new found fame or anything...</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2013#5916">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2013#5916</a></p><p>Some of them are also posting under false names as well...</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2027&amp;next=1">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2027&amp;next=1</a></p><p> Personally I don't think the site has changed that much since the revamp in 
    story terms... Harry always used to go on about everything being "cool", 
    and I'm pretty sure older readers remember the "ZX Shrink Chamber" 
    story appearing the in the first issue of Senior Citizen- that was 
    an untrue story as well!!! (See <a href="1.html#20"> issue 1</a>...) 
    The main difference is the adding of the "talkback" section to the 
    articles, giving free-rein to anyone that wants to slag off Harry 
    and his burgeoning celebrity status!!!</p>
