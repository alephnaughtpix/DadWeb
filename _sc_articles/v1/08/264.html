<p>Well, you might be fuming over that Ant &amp; Dec show replacing the
    <b>Chart Show</b> on saturday mornings- but there's one bright spark in
    the gloom!!!! The hilariously titled "<b>SMTV://Live</b>" will include the
    very first terrestrial TV broadcast of the brilliant cartoon "<b>Cow
    &amp; Chicken</b>"!!!!!! This is great!!! If they can get away with putting
    "Cow &amp; Chicken" (Which is only slightly more gross than "Ren &amp; Stimpy"!!!)
    on in the mornings, then it won't be long before the other brilliant
    <b>Cartoon Network</b> creations such as "<b>Dexters Lab</b>" and "<b>Johnny
    bravo</b>" come along to grace our screens!!!! On the other hand, if all the
    parents start complaining, it may be the only chance you get to see it on
    terrestrial TV!!!</p>
