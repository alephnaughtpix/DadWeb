<p>How about this!?!? Apparently if you take drugs and stuff in nightclubs, you
    become not very well!!!! What's new about that you may think... Well, some
    br/ight spark has decided to call the bit where people are not feeling too well
    <i>"Saturday Night Fever"</i>!!!!! I suppose they'll be saying next that if
    you take drugs, you'll have trouble "Stayin' Alive", and it'll give you the
    "hee-bee-gee-bees"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
