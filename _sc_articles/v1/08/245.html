<p>Have you been on Usenet recently, and noticed no-one was posting on your
    group?!?!?! Well, your newsgroup might have been the victims of the zillions
    of cancel messages that have been going around Usenet of late!!! Apparently
    some nefarious types are using some free crap accounts to cancel zillions
    of Usenet messages, and are getting away with it!!! The article below suggests
    that it might be an attempt to disrupt some newsgroups, but we've also seen
    a major flame-war session from a bunch of saddoes called "<b>Hell Flame
    Wars</b>", who basically conduct an on-going flamewar amongst themselves,
    and crosspost to completely irrelevant newsgroups, to rope them in as well!!
    We wouldn't be too surprised if a lot of cancels were going in their
    direction!!!</p><p><a href="http://7am.com/cgi-bin/twires.cgi?1000_t9808310.htm">http://7am.com/cgi-bin/twires.cgi?1000_t9808310.htm</a></p>
