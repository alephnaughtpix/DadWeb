<p>Well, everyone's going on about Diana this week, so we might as well do
    something for this "one year on..." tribute thingy!!!!</p><p>Anyway, this is an "interesting" re-write of "Candle in the Wind '98" that
    was was done right after the funeral... Apparently the webite suddenly went
    down afterwards for a short time..... (Warning!!! This is definately going
    to be offensive to some!!! Apparently you're also supposed to turn cookies
    off...)</p><p><a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/harlot.html">http://www.godhatesfags.com/harlot.html</a>
<p>And how about this for an interesting "Church newsletter"?!?!?! Hmmm, I'd
    like to see what would happen if someone were to print out a few copies and
    put it in their local church in place of their normal newsletters!??!?!?!</p>

<p>BTW the reason I said turn off cookies was that the above two pages aren't
    actually someone's idea of a joke!!!! The bloke behind it is a "Reverend"
    type person in the US who is apparently a bit of a right-wing extremist
    who pickets people's funerals, sends off invective filled faxes about
    people he doesn't like to newspapers, and acts generally like an all-round
    not-very-nice person!!! You might have noticed the very "subtle" URLs above,
    but according to the links in the page below, there aren't very much people
    that he doesn't hate!!! (Expect maybe right-wing nazis!!!!)</p>
