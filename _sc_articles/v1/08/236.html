<p>If you're an computeing old-timer like us, you may remember these funny
    programs on 16-bit machines called <b>demos</b>!!! They're not the half-finished
    games you get on magazine coverdisks as you might think!!!! They're actually
    really spiffy little audio-visual experiences done for fun, like the ones
    we do!!!! One of the first demos I saw was this amazingly spangly little
    production on my little ST in 1989 called "<b>The Union Demo</b>" with loads
    of whizzy effects!!!! Well, in 1998, someone called <b>Demografica</b> has
    decided to convert it to the PC!!!! At the moment
    all that's been done is conversion of some of the chip music and graphics,
    but surely it can't be that hard to convert all the "rasters",
    "fullscreens", and "bitmap scrollers" to the PC and all it's supey-dupey
    graphics and sound capabilities!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~redrob/Union/">http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~redrob/Union/</a></p><p>You can already run the original Atari version (mostly) on the PC thanks to
    Pacifist ST emulator... Well, I say "original"- it's actually a version of
    the demo cracked by the infamous ST demo-rippers <b>Ripped Off</b>, and put
    on a compilation menu by <b>Persistance of Vision</b> some time in the early
    1990s!!! The really wierd thing is that you can't get an *<i>original</i>*
    copy of the Union demo over the Internet because the original version was in
    a wierd custom disk format that could not be copied by any disk copier on the
    ST!!!! It could only be copied by an inbuilt copier program included with
    the actual demo!!!! This means it couldn't be spread by any other means,
    including bulletin boards and FTP!!!!!! Really thinking ahead, weren't
    they?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~celeborn/sync/files/demos/union.zip">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~celeborn/sync/files/demos/union.zip</a></p><p>Pacifist is at...</p><p><a href="http://pacifist.fatal-design.com/">http://pacifist.fatal-design.com/</a></p>
