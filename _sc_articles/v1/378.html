<p>We've recently been looking at the <b>MTV UK</b> website, and although it looks like a Shockwave 
    nightmare, it does have one little interesting feature- Fantasy Bands!!!! 
    It's like that Fantasy Football, expect that, er, instead of football, 
    it's bands!!!!!!! We're now entering the fray with our own heavy metal 
    band called <b>Vigilante Shipbuilders</b>, composed of Danbert from Chumbawumba, 
    Danny Macnamara from Embrace, and Missy Elliot!!! We hope to get to 
    no. 1 with that line-up!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk:80/point4?ac=000093387127875&amp;rtmo=f3vfofls&amp;atmo=99999999&amp;manager=0000933871&amp;artist=228&amp;FBM_ACTION=addartist&amp;comment=0.inc&amp;pg=/mtve/mtve/fbm/setup/fbmhomeaction.html">http://www.mtv.co.uk:80/point4?ac=000093387127875&amp;rtmo=f3vfofls&amp;atmo=99999999</a></p>
