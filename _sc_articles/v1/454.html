    we don't put dimes in our jukebox, because we're not American!!!!!!!!!! But we would for
    this jukebox, because it *<b>is</b>* American!!!!!! And it's online!!!!!!! Sony &amp; RealNetworks have
    teamed up for this pay-per-listen scheme thingy on tha w3!!!! Of course, you could always
    put your own CDs on your own PC, and charge yourself money for it!!!!!!! You would be
    surprised at the profit you could make!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15971.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15971.html</a></p>
