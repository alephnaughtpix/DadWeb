<p>Well, one bunch who are going to be a bit annoyed by the above survey are
    the internet commerce dudes, who according to the following article are
    depending on the emotions of the average web-surfer!!! Apparently they're
    using stuff like br/and names and nice web-sites to make the surfers happy
    to part with their money!!! The only problem is that now you can get
    internet shopping search engines (See <a href="6.html#188"> issue 6</a>...)
    to search for the lowest price, which throws their strategy out of the
    window!!!!!! So I reckon if "HomeNet" did a survey on them, it would be
    found that working in Internet commerce makes you sad and lonely!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ohio.com/bj/business/netrider/docs/006101.htm">http://www.ohio.com/bj/business/netrider/docs/006101.htm</a></p>
