<p>Have you ever 
    been walking in the Texas plains, got bit by a rattlesnake, and thought: 
    "Hmmm!!!! Those Mozilla people should really be taking notes here if 
    they want to fit their browser onto a single floppy disk!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!?!? 
    Well, obviously someone has, because the first major new release from 
    the Mozilla open source thingy is this thingy called "<b>Gecko</b>", 
    (Which is of course named after those fabulous series of video games!!!) 
    which is a really small browser and HTML rendering engine thingy, which 
    fits on a floppy when zipped!!!!!! Apparently, this is going to be part 
    of the new Netscape v5 browsey-wowsey!!!!! You'll probably need to download 
    an "antidote" with it in case it bites you tho!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/wd-news/1998/12/0702-netscape.html">http://www.internetnews.com/wd-news/1998/12/0702-netscape.html</a></p>
