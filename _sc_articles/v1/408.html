<p>Some of you "older" readers may remember the really hi-tech scheme by the
    Russians to put mirrors in space to reflect sunlight, and turn night "off"
    in selected Russian cities where the days aren't really long enough!!!!
    The last time we talked about this, the big plans were off because they
    didn't have enough money!!!! Then some time after, all this Russian Financial
    Crisis business started, so we thought that was definately it- no more
    "mirrors in space" plans now!!!!! So we were a bit surprised to find out that
    the plans are suddenly back on!!!!! Only thing is, they've been cut down a
    bit... Now there's only one mirror getting sent up!!!!! But if it works,
    they're planning on sending a couple more up!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15800.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15800.html</a></p>
