title: "We're using an MS patent!!!!!!!!!!!"
issue: 24

<p>And we didn't even know it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because as part of a
    well-designed website (Well, OK, we are going to update the look pretty
    soon- stop annoying us you impatient people!!!!!!!!!!!) we are using the
    world-wide standard of webby <b>stylesheets</b> to help us with certain
    thingies such as font styles and so on... Well, MS has only gone and patented
    this idea!!!!!!!!! And it's atually patented "stylesheets" as a general idea,
    so this affects all it's competitors wordprocessing software, as well as
    every SGML document system, and future standards such as XML, which rely on
    stylesheets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  <p> Luckily MS are allowing people to use stylesheets for free, and US patents 
    such as this one don't apply to our webserver, (Which is based Glasgow, 
    Scotland, MS Lawyers!!!!!!!!!!) but there is some doubt as to whether 
    MS can legally patent something which is already an open standard 
    and has been for some time!!!!!!!!! Mind you, this doesn't seem to 
    have stopped MS before- a quick look at the US patents database website 
    shows that MS have patented quite a few things that could be considered 
    already existing open standards!!!! Some people are suggesting that 
    this is part of the "battle plan" as detailed in the <b>Hallowe'en 
    Memo</b>, (See <a href="15.html#449"> issue 15</a>...) whereby MS 
    are supposed to "embrace and extend" existing open source standards, 
    so that no-one else can use them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
