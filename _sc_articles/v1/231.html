<p>You might have heard about that big drum shaped thingy that you push people
    into in hospitals and it scans them!!! Well, it's called a "cat-scan"!!!!
    So when we heard there was a "cat scan" competition, we thought it might
    have been the best looking scans of peoples internal organs!!! But we were
    wrong!!! It's actually pictures made by people who pushed their pet cats
    onto scanners and scanned them!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cat-scan.com/">http://www.cat-scan.com/</a></p>
