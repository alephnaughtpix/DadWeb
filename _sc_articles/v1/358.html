<p>Some dudes in the US are a bit worried because in the Washington state (Which
    is different from where Washingtion actually is!!!! One of these days, Bill
    Clinton is going to get mixed up, and then where will we be?!?!??!)) there's a
    whole lot of radioactive areas outside of the Hanford "nuclear reservation"
    (Wot, like for radioactive native americans?!??!), and they think it might
    be spread by <b>insects</b>!!!!! Like those big ants in that black and white
    movie from the 1950s "<b>Them!</b>"!!!!!! Well, OK, probably not like them,
    or somebody would have noticed!!!!!!!! Mind you, maybe someone did notice
    gigantic ants roaming around, but when they told anyone else they would answer
    <i>"Oh ha ha!!!!! That sounds exactly like that black and white
    movie from the 1950s '<b>Them!</b>'!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/038053.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/038053.htm</a></p>
