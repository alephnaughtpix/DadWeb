<p>Kvetch!!!!!!!!! Don't worry, I'm not sneezing there!!!!!!!!! In fact, I'm informing 
    you of an interesting idea on tha netweb with really great potential!!!! 
    OK, I don't know what "kvetch" actually means, but it's the name of 
    a website, where you can view short and sharp little rants on various 
    subjects by various people... And about 30 seconds later, the site randomly 
    loads another one!!!! You can of course add your own rant to the mix, 
    and annoy loads of other people with your superior intillect!!!!!</p><p>Now if that was it, it would be just a vaguely interesting site, 
    but wait- there's more!!!! That zappy <b>Zing!</b> crowd have teamed
    up with Kvetch, and have started putting Kvetch "comments" on Zing!!! 
    So you can put some comment into the Kvetch, and then some time later 
    you might be surfing the web- and your Kvetch comment suddenly appears 
    in Zing whilst you're surfing!!!!</p><p>Now it doesn't take a genius to work out that you could use this 
    idea for something like an Internet noticeboard for not-too-urgent 
    messages- stick the message and a contact addr into the website, and 
    the messages are converted for Zing! or whatever, so that it can download 
    them, and then while you're surfing, you can see the messages, and 
    reply to them!!!!!</p><p>Neat idea, huh?!?! So if you're thinking of it, Zing! peeps, please 
    credit us for it!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.kvetch.com/">http://www.kvetch.com/</a></p>
