<p>According to this article, most hacking is usually an "inside job"!!!!!!! Er, call me
    pedantic, but if it's an inside job, then presumably you don't need to hack in from "outside",
    because you're not outside, you're inside!!!!!!!!!!!! So what exactly is being hacked then?!??!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_203000/203133.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_203000/203133.stm</a></p>
