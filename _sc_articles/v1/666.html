    If you as old as me, you might dimly remember a spiffy little musical 
    group called <b>The KLF</b>!!!!!!! You might even remember that they 
    were also called <b>The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu</b> or <b>The JAMMs</b>, 
    and they did this interesting album called "<b>1987: What the F@&amp;%s 
    Going On?"</b>, which had loadsa samples on it!!!!! Unfortuntely one 
    of the people sampled was Abba, and their manager decided to sue their 
    rear entrances off the JAMMs unless they destroyed the album and it's 
    master tapes!!!!!!!!!!!! So they did!!!!!! And it's now an extremely 
    difficult album to get hold of!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Fast forward 12 years later, and we were checking out the latest 
      new music in the vaults of <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a> 
      , and we found a section for a group called "<b>The Jams</b>", and 
      yep, apparently it's the same lot!!!!!!! And there's two new tunes 
      from them on their section!!!!!! The first of them is called <b>"3AM 
      Impure Trance</b>, which is billed as <i>"The White House Music Anthem, 
      featuring the vocal talents of Mrs.Hillary Rodham Clinton."</i>!!!!!! 
      The second is called <b>"Viva Viagra"</b>, and I bet you can't guess 
      what that's all about!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/jams">http://www.mp3.com/jams</a> </p><p>But that's not all!!!!!!! These two tracks are apparently tasters 
      for a new JAMMs album called *"<b>2987</b>"*, which is being released 
      on 23rd February!!!!!! Why the music papers haven't reported on this 
      momentous occasion, we do not know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But you can read 
      about it on their slightly cheapo looking website here... Well, they've 
      burned a million pounds, what do you expect their website to look 
      like?!?!?! Really professional?!?!?!?! </p><p><a href="http://members.xoom.com/2987/">http://members.xoom.com/2987/</a></p>
