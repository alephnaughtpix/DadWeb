<p>Well, this might 
    make the inpho-pipe-web a little safer for kids.... If you regularly 
    watch that nice man <b>Frank Black</b> in that spooky TV series <b>Millenium</b>, 
    you might know that he searches for naughty men by "profiling" them!!!!! 
    What you might not know is that some company has just announced it's 
    going to do the same!!!! Yep, they're going to "profile" your netweb 
    surfing data!!!!!! Presumably to see if you're a serial killer or something...</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/be_free_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/be_free_1.html</a></p>
