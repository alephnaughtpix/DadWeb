<p>Well, we've been reading <a href="news://alt.music.mp3/">news://alt.music.mp3/</a> for
    some "tips" on MP3 music, and we've been finding some rather sarcastic responses
    to common questions....</p><pre class="usenet">Loth wrote in message &lt;6tes9d$ejo$1@front2.grolier.fr&gt;...
&gt;Does anybody know if there's a way to read midi files with Winamp ?
&gt;If the answer is "no", is there a way to convert mid to mp3 ???
&gt;
&gt;Thx in advance
