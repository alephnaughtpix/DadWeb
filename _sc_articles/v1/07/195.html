<p>The guys from 
    Bandaii and Hasbro (Who are taking a bit of a break from buying things 
    with "Falcons" in them (See <a href="5.html#158"> issue 5</a>...) !!!!) 
    have come up with an, erm, interesting new idea!!! How does this grab 
    you.... You get a lollipop, right, and you stick in this "holder" thingy, 
    which contains recordings of various sound efffects... And the holder 
    takes the sound data, and vibrates the lolly, so that you get all the 
    sounds in your head!!!!!!! Well, a lot of people seem to like the idea 
    anyway!!!! If you're a regular reader, (See <a href="6.html#174"> issue 
    6</a>...) you'll probably say it's "Technical yummy"- literally!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980821/sound_bite_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980821/sound_bite_1.html</a></p><p><b>Note (Thu 27 Aug)</b>- UK TV Telextext magazine <b>Digitiser</b> has
    picked up on the story, and they did the "voices in the head" joke as well!!!</p>
