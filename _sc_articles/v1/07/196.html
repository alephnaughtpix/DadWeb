<p>Apparently those progs to defeat that NT hacking program 
    <b>"Back Orifice"</b> are not very good!!! Apparently you just 
    need to fiddle about with the settings on Back Orifice and 
    it'll defeat the two main anti-Back Orifice proggies!!!</p><p>BTW Oddly enough, someone in the old folks home has just noticed 
    about this Back Orifice lark after it was written up in a little 
    feature in the Mail on Sunday!!! Apparently they were going on 
    about it like it was a virus or something!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,3441,2130140,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,3441,2130140,00.html</a></p>
