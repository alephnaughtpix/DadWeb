<p>What does Queen Victoria, the Mona Lisa, the Palmpilot have in common!?!?! Nope, 
    I've not just collected them all together in a sentence!!!!! You see, 
    Queen Victoria is (or was, to be more accurate!!!!!!) a royal, and a 
    company called Royal Consumer Business Products have just annouced 
    a low-cost handheld computer to undercut the main handheld computer 
    Palmpilot, and it's called the Da Vinci, which is named after the 
    bloke who painted the Mona Lisa!!!! You can tell I've been watching 
    "3-2-1!" on Challenge TV, can't you?!??!!?</p><p><a href="http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980825S0010">http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19980825S0010</a></p>
