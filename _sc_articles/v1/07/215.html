<p>Guess what I noticed in <b>Wired News</b>!?!? A news 
    story on the <b>World of Atari</b> show in Las Vegas!!!! 
    It's not the first Wired story I've seen to mention Atari stuff 
    as well!!! At least it's not like in the UK where they'd go: <i>"Phew, 
    crickey Grandad, you must be a complete trainspotting anorack!!! 
    Go back to your 8-track and black and white TV!!!"</i></p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14613.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/14613.html</a></p>
