<p>You know about the business of some pet owners getting little 
    computer chips implanted in their pets so that they know where 
    they are!?!?!? Wouldn't it be a bit "off" if the government did 
    the same with humans?!?!? Well, one scientest has decided to find 
    out.... By getting a chip implanted in him!!! Now he can walk 
    into his office, and a little speech synth will tell him how 
    many emails he has!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14635.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/14635.html</a></p>
