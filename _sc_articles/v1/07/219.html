<p>Yes, it's true!!! The popular young person's beat music weekly, and former 
    "jazz" mag, <b>Melody Maker</b> had seen fit to print a letter 
    by <b>me</b>!!! I wrote a letter to complaining about a whole series of 
    disgusting pictures in an issue of MM, and they printed it!!! And they 
    didn't slag it off either!!!! They censored it slightly, presumably for reasons 
    of space, as I couldn't see any other reason for some of the changes!!!! For 
    example, they censored my reference to "rock music journalism"!!!!!! 
  <p>Still the fact that this <b>Robin Bresnark</b> person, who was editing the letters 
    pages this week, chose to make small changes like that means that he obviously 
    was making an effort include my letter as he thought it was so bloody brillliant!!! 
    One thing I didn't like tho- they censored all the exclamation marks!!!!! So much 
    for youthful exhuberence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>You can find a copy of my original letter <a href="extras/mm.html">here</a>!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh dear- appearing on VH-1 (See <a href="5.html#146"> issue 5</a>...) , now 
    this!!!!! We really ought to start a rock band!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Interestingly, 
    <b>Jackson Pollock</b> claims to be in a beat combo called <b>Basil</b>, 
    but I haven't heard any of their stuff yet!!!)</p>
