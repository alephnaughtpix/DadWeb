<p><i>"God does not play dice!"</i> So said brainy bloke Albert Einstien. 
    Mind you, he dated Marilyn Monroe for a bit, so he obviously couldn't 
    have been using his brain all the time!!!!!! So it's not too suprising 
    he got the odd thing wrong from time to time!!! Apparently scientests 
    have found that God actually *<b>does</b>* play dice!!! Well, not really 
    literally, obviously!!!!!! What they mean is that things happen randomly 
    in quantum physics which is a little different really!!!! Anyway, they've 
    found out why- apparently if there wasn't random things happening in 
    quantum physics, we'd be able to break the speed of light and really 
    muck up causality!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.newscientist.co.uk/ns/980822/features.html">http://www.newscientist.co.uk/ns/980822/features.html</a></p><p>BTW We saw this article get a mention on <b>Slashdot</b>!!! It's good to see 
    the dudes there read New Scientest as well as us!!! (See <a href="5.html#166">
