<p>Now this is really wierd!!! Just as we were ready to give up on this 
    lot, they suddenly turn not to be dead after all!!!! Almost one month 
    after the debut issue appeared, and 3 weeks after both the websites 
    disappeared, the original website goes up again!! (Tues 25th Aug!!) 
    No explanation is given though, as the page put up at the old Gamerush 
    site URL is exactly the same as when it went down!!! We dunno if this 
    is some sort of subtle "Zen" publicity policy or what!!! But before 
    this latest development, over the past couple of weeks we're trying 
    to find out what on Earth happened to "Scotland the Raw" since the 
    two websites went down on Thu 8 Aug... (See <a href="5.html#163"> issue 
    5</a>...) </p><p>We used loadsa websearches, we trawled the news using <b>Deja-News</b>-
    nothing!!!! Nada!!! Zippo!!! Seems no-one's heard of "Scotland the Raw"
    ezine on the Internet!!! (Except readers of this mag of course!!!!) The
    last thing we did before we jacked it in was to send an enquiry into a
    couple of Scottish-related newsgroups asking if anyone had heard of it,
    and knew what had happened to it!!! We sent a message to <a href="news://soc.culture.scottish/">news://soc.culture.scottish/</a>
    on Monday night, and got one of our friends who has access to local Scottish
    newsgroups sent a message of their own on Tuesday.... Then suddenly,
    on Tuesday the Gamerush webpage reappeared!!!! (Hmmmmm... What a strange
    coincidence!!!) At the time of writing though, the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a>
    address is still non-existant!!!</p><p>Perhaps the re-appearance of the website, with it's contact email addr for
    subscriptions to the zine, is their subtle way of gearing up for a second issue?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.html">http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.html</a></p>
