<p>Remember in the old days, computers in films and TV used to have loads of blinking 
    lights all over them!!?!? Well, those days might be long gone, but you 
    can recreate them with the <b>PulseBox</b>!!!! It's erm, a load of blinking 
    LEDs that flash in time with whatever your computer is doing!!!! They 
    actually tell you what you need and how to do in the link below, so you 
    can also be transported back to the days of <b>Hobby Electronic</b> magazine 
    as well!!!!! Only thing is you need the new-fangled BeOS to run it!!!! 
    (So no prob for Colostomy Bag, as he already has it!!!!) Mind you, I 
    can't wait for Glen Larson Sci-Fi TV Series Sound Effects Emulator tho!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.archi-line.de/kaenner/Seiten/PulseBox.html">http://www.archi-line.de/kaenner/Seiten/PulseBox.html<br/></a></p><p><a href="http://www.fho-emden.de/~www42/pulsebox/index.html">http://www.fho-emden.de/~www42/pulsebox/index.html</a></p>
