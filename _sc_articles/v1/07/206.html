<p>According to the following article, someone's done a whole book based on
    Internet Radio stations!!! Apparently, there's more radio stations on the Internet
    than on radio!!!!! This is news to me!!!!! Mind you, apparently web radio doesn't
    come up very well in search engines!!!! But even when I find them, I can't seem to
    receive them. Mind you, that might be because I've got a 300 baud modem!!!!!!!!!
