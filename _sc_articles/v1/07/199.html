<p>We've already covered the boat made out of rubbish, (See <a href="6.html#167"> issue 
    6</a>...) but how about computers made up out of old bits chucked out 
    of PCs?!?! Well, people with Linux boxes already know about that as 
    a lot of people with Linux boxes have made them out of the old out-of-date 
    parts that can't run the lastest software on their current Wintel PCs!!! 
    Well, someone's taken it to another level by linking a whole lot of 
    them together in a "Beowulf" network!!!! What *that* is I do not know, 
    but it's supposed to be big anyway, so it's impressive that they can 
    do it with old bits of computers!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/facilities/beowulf/">http://www.esd.ornl.gov/facilities/beowulf/</a></p><p>But a team in Holland have gone one better!!!! They've actually made a
    supercomputer out of *<b>BROKEN</b>* parts!!!!! You might wonder how the hell the
    flippin' thing can work at all, never mind racing along '100 times faster than a
    top-end workstation'!!!! Well, they're using loads of spiffy software as diagnostic
    tools to correct the errors in the broken parts!!! They're actually seriously
    going for a trillion instructions per second on this thing!!! So, it might be
    rubbish, but it's very fast rubbish!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/Forbes/98/0907/6205210a.htm">http://www.forbes.com/Forbes/98/0907/6205210a.htm</a></p>
