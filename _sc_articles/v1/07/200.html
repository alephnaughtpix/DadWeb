<p>This is pretty impressive!!! While I've been getting into MP3, I've 
    been keeping my ear on the ground to hear what's new in MPEG-land!!! 
    (Well, obviously I've not literally got my ear on the ground, as that 
    would be really silly wouldn't it!!!! No, I'm actually reading web 
    pages about it actually!!!!)</p><p>Anyway, I was recently in a sort of "argument" with someone on <a href="news://alt.digitiser/">news://alt.digitiser/</a> 
    about General MIDI versus soundtracker modules for music. This guy 
    argued (pretty reasonably) that GM was portable between machines and 
    sounded good on a proper MIDI setup, whilst I argued that you didn't 
    have that much control over how GM sounds on a machine but on soundtracker 
    mods you have complete control within the (comparatively limited) format, 
    and they sound the same on all the machines. The only problem was there 
    there are a lot of different soundtracker formats and they vary from 
    platform to platform!!!! So what we really would need is a format that 
    has the portability of GM, but allows the complete control of sound 
    that you can get with soundtracker mods!!!!!</p><p>Sounds a tall order?!?! Well say hello to <strong>MP4</strong>!!! It's pencilled
    in for proper "launch" later this year, but the specs are online, and audio-wise
    it looks like the ultimate format that soundtracker fans have been looking for!!!
    Don't confuse this with MP3 tho- it's as different as Cubase is to an old 8-track
    cartridge!!! You can play bits of sampled sound like in MP3, but you can also play
    "instruments" in a MIDI stylee, and add effects to them like reverb and so on...
    What's really interesting is that they're not just instruments of the sampled
    type- they can be "synthesised", and we're not talking about cheapo sounding
    synths here, we're talking about all the latest techniques used in the new keyboards
    like: vector synthesis, physical modelling, emulation of analogue and so on!!!
    Obviously the drawbacks here are that you'd need a bloody good processor to to do
    all this sort of stuff!!! The other prob I can see is that tracker progs using MP4
    would almost be as complex as MIDI progs, with loadsa special plugin progs to fully
    use the synthy bits!!! (eg 303 emulators, anyone?!?!)</p><p>I've only just talked about the audio stuff, but the video bit of MP4 looks almost
    as good!!! Apparently you can make "synthetic people" to talk along with dialog, and
    plonk people in front of backgrounds and so on... Looks like a format you can make
    wacky video and audio with!!!! It'll probably kill your Pentium tho!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/mpeg/standards/mpeg-4/mpeg-4.htm">http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/mpeg/standards/mpeg-4/mpeg-4.htm</a></p><p>If you haven't heard any soundtracker mods (Where are you been!!!!), go to:</p><p><a href="http://www.hornet.org/info/zentrack/">http://www.hornet.org/info/zentrack/</a></p>
