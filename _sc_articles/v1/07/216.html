<p>One of the probs with mobile phones is that you can't get away 
    from people calling you!!! Now it's going to be the same with 
    email, as some company called Magellan have done this pager thingy 
    that allows you to sent and receive email from anywhere in 
    world!!! I reckon the people that get these gizmos will have a bit 
    of a prob getting away from spam emails!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.magellangps.com/Wireless/GSC100/GSC100Wr.html">http://www.magellangps.com/Wireless/GSC100/GSC100Wr.html</a></p>
