<p>As we've been starting to promote our zine, we've been looking at various zine
    indexes and other zines, and there's a lot of them!!! So here are reviews of a
    few of them... We've noticed a couple of recurring categories so far:</p><ul>
<li>Music zines!!! (Not as common as you may think!!!)
    <li>Writing &amp; Poetry!!!
    <li>Teen zines!!!
    <li>Riot Grrl zines!!! (These are really popular!!!)
    <li>"Hip" zines, with really "clever" "essays" about culture and technology!!!
  </li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>The last bunch are the most irritating, so we'll try and give them a miss here!!!
    Anyway, here are a few we tried at complete random!!!!<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Suffering is Hip</b></dt>
<dd><p>The name almost really put us off this one!!! But the graphics are really
      nice, and the writing isn't all barely readable "<b>Suck.com</b>" type stuff!!!
      And the actual point of the site is to take the piddle out of "serious" art, so
      that's pretty decent, although we wouldn't mind if they took the piddle a little
      more, and not take themselves too seriously while they're at it!!!</p>

<dt><b>The Bits</b></dt>
<dd><p>This is an interesting one, as it's not trying to be painfully hip like a lot of
      zines!!! One good feature is that in some sections, there's a form to add your
      own stuff, a bit like on Slashdot!!!</p>

<dt><b>AKP Zine</b></dt>
<dd><p>We really like this one!!! The site has a nice clean design, and more
      importantly the articles are pretty good!!! If you're used to stuff like
      the articles in <a href="../../saggie/default.html"><b>Maggie</b></a> diskmag, then you'll like this!!!</p>

<dt><b>MOiRAzine</b></dt>
<dd><p>When you enter this site, you get a Javascript dialog saying <i>"If you like
      blowjobs, click on OK"</i>!!! The heading on the top of the next page is
      <i>"Slutty is good"</i>!!!! So you might get the idea that this is not a
      very subtle site!!!! And you'd be right!!! But it's quite funny!!!</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn't really look like a zine at all, more a sort of wierd homepage!!!

<p>That's all for the moment, as I'm flippin' tired!!! (Editing a brilliant zine
      like this is hard work!!!!!</p>
