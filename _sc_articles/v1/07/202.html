<p>If you've been in Linux for more than a few months, then no doubt you'll have 
    heard of <b>The Gimp</b>!!!! Nope, it's not a mysterious leather-clad Linux 
    and S&amp;M enthusiast!!!! It's actually a free Photoshop clone for Linux!!! 
    (Gimp stands for "GNU Image Manipulation Program"!!!!) We've used it a 
    bit ourselves, and we can say it's one of the first real "killer apps" 
    we've seen on the Linux platform!!! And now someone's done a port for 
    Windows so all you Wintel fans can see how good it is!!! But not quite 
    yet, because it's in an early stage ATM!! But since it's a free prog 
    like the original Gimp, it'll means that less people will pirate Photoshop, 
    so it's quite a good thing of course!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.isl.net/~setera/gimp/gimpw32.html">http://www.isl.net/~setera/gimp/gimpw32.html</a></p><p>And even Adobe are giving the Gimp a plug!!!! Read this letter from Adobe 
    about the likelihood of porting Photoshop to Linux... Generally they "Sorry, 
    not enough demand!!!! Why not try Gimp instead?!?!?!"</p><p><a href="http://seanshardware.com/adobe/">http://seanshardware.com/adobe/</a></p>
