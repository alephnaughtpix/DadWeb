<p>This is probably old news, but not old to Senior Citizen!!!!
    <p>
    Anyway, as they said
    in "<b>Killer Net</b>": 95% of the Internet is used for porn- or something like
    that!!!! Well, I have my doubts, because I've just seen <b>Metaspy Unfiltered</b>,
    which is the uncensored versh of <b>Metaspy</b>, which lets you know what people
    are searching for in <b>Metacrawler</b>, and 95% of it is *<i>not</i>* about porno!!! In fact,
    here's some of the requests we saw in whilst we were on for a few minutes...</p>
