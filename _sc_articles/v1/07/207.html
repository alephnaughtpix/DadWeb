<p>Aaah!!! Now this 
    warms the cockles of my heart!!!!! Somewhere in Holland between thee 
    15th and 17th Dec 2000, there's going to be a 10th anniversary of the 
    first <b>ST News Christmas Coding Convention</b>!!! The organisers, 
    the former team of <b>ST News</b>, one of the best diskmags ever, intend 
    to get all the people from the original convention back together, as 
    well as others!!! This includes all those famous coders, graphists and 
    musicians from the boom times of the ST demo scene!!! So of course, 
    we're interested in going ourselves!!!! After all, we've managed to 
    get the Atari scene onto VH-1!!!! (See <a href="5.html#146"> issue 5</a>...) 
    So we must be pretty important as well!!!
