<p>Nope, we're not talking about flamewars here!!! We're talking about 
    emulated fireworks!!!! Yep, in tha future when all outdoor fireworks 
    are banned by Daily Mail readers, you'll still be able to enjoy 
    "virtual" fireworks by booting up you Linux box and running "Pyro"!!! 
    Well, I don't mean "booting" it literally, as you would damage the 
    thing!!!! Anyway, most *<b>real</b>* Linux bods apparently never shut 
    down their machines!!! At least so says this book I'm reading called 
    "Linux Fashion for Complete Spanners"!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~oliphant/pyro/">http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~oliphant/pyro/</a></p>
