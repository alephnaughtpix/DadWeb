<p>Remember the "Spartan Horse" we told you about last week? (See <a href="6.html#176"> issue 
    6</a>...) Well, someone's been quick on the draw, and found a rather 
    sneaky way of using it!!!! You might remember Microsoft bought over 
    <b>Hotmail</b>, the free web-based email service... Well, you can send 
    web pages as mail using Hotmail!!! Yep, you guessed it, you can include 
    Javascript in the mail!!! So someone's done a mail which includes Javascript 
    dialog which makes like you've just logged out of Hotmail, and then 
    asks you for your Hotmail username and password and mails it to someone!!! 
    What's really sneaky is that as Hotmail is owned by MS, they're more 
    likely to be punting it to their Internet Explorer-using users, and 
    the "Spartan Horse" trick looks much more convincing in IE!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/">http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/</a></p><p><b>Update (Fri 28 Aug)</b> - MS is going to get around this by getting Hotmail
    to strip away Javascript from any web pages sent as email!!! What if it's a
    "nice" Javascript program!?!? Seems a bit of stupid idea to me, as it's
    hardly fixing the original "Spartan Horse" problem in the first place!!! MS
    should really be making sure Javascript dialogs in IE look noticably
    different from system dialogs so that no-one's fooled by them!!!<p>
