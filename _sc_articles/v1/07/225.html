<p>Well, one good thing about the Internet is that whenever a natural
    disaster happens, you can always watch a spiffy movie or computer
    simulation of it over and over again on the web!!!! Now you can watch a
    computer model of that tidal wave that killed zillions in Papua
    New Guinea!!! For good measure, I recommend playing "Papua New Guinea"
    by the Future Sound of London whilst viewing the movie!!!</p><p><a href="http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/docs/tsunami/PNGhome.html">http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/docs/tsunami/PNGhome.html</a></p>
