<p>Have you ever saw a small light zip across the sky, and thought "My!!! 
    I've seen a satellite!!! I wonder what that would look like in a 3D model 
    rendered by a Java program!??!?!" Well, now you can find out thanks to 
    NASA!!! They've done a 3D model of all satellites launched and you view 
    it in some sort of new fangled Java window, and do all the usual "virtual 
    reality" things like zoom and click around and so on... You can even do 
    a simulated time-lapse of their orbits and see them go around the Earth 
    very quickly, like a lot of midges!!!! So, coming from Scotland, I find 
    it quite reassuringly familiar!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3d.html">http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3d.html</a></p>
