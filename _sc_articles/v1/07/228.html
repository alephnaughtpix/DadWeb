<p>Well, you might have thought that all this web-shopping business was
    just an American thing (See <a href="6.html#188"> issue 6</a>...) , but look at this!!! 
    Here's a guide to online shopping based in the *<b>UK</b>*!!!! It's actually a kind of 
    "<b>Which?</b>" for online shops, as all the shopping sites listed are reviewed, and 
    their various features and ease of use discussed... This is actually a pretty decent site!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.enterprisecity.co.uk/">http://www.enterprisecity.co.uk/</a></p>
