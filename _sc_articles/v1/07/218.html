<p>Well, "Scotland The Raw" might have to watch out because there's 
    another Scottish satirical mag on tha W3!!! It's "Rogue Parcel" 
    (As in "such a parcel of rogues for a nation", from that Rabbie C 
    Burns poem "Such a parcel of rogues for a nation"!!!) and although 
    the site appears to have a bit of a strange idea as regards to web design, it's 
    actually quite good!! The articles and short and sharp and to the 
    point, the range of subjects covered is pretty varied, and the 
    writer/s appears to be completely cyncial about everything and are 
    pretty funny!!! (The editor also gives a really good email impersonation 
    of a tetchy old git!!!!) And they've done their second issue and are working 
    on their third!!!! So "Scotland The Raw" already has a bit of 
    serious competition!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/4813/">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/4813/</a></p>
