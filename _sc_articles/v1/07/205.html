<p>This is a wierd one!!!! According to an Aussie Finiancial website, many PCs might 
    survive the year 2000 and instead completely trip up on the year 2001!!!!!! 
    In the URL below an MS guy says that some PC BIOS chips aren't really 
    Y2K complaint, but Windows can handle that!!! Unfortunately, it can't 
    handle it in 2001!!! Erm... So why didn't they fix it for 2001 then?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.afr.com.au/content/980820/inform/inform1.html">http://www.afr.com.au/content/980820/inform/inform1.html</a></p>
