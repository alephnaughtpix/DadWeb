<p>It may sound amazing, but there are people who have been in
    computing longer than I have!!!! Here's a story about the very
    first computer programmers... And they're all women!!! It seems
    that when they invented this new-fangled computer thingy, because
    it had a keyboard, the blokes gave the work to all the
    secretaries!!!! Now the women here are having the last laugh
    since they because they became the first computing geeks decades
    before loads of spotty little guys made it fashionable!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980825/witi_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980825/witi_1.html</a></p>
