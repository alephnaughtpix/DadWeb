<p>You know <b>Nike</b>- 
    the lot that are spelled "nike", but are pronounced "Nike, hey!!!"!??!?!?! 
    Did you get one of their shoes this Xmas!?!?!? Well, apparently, you 
    can now use it as a vacuum cleaner!!!! This is because apparently Nike 
    (hey!) really sucks!!!!! At least, so say this little site, the "Nike 
    Sucks" webring!!!! It's run by some person called "Punk Ska", so maybe 
    he's American or something.</p><p><a href="http://www.oeonline.com/~chevy/nike_sucks.html">http://www.oeonline.com/~chevy/nike_sucks.html</a></p>
