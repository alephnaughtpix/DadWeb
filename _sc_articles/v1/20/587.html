<p>Those UK Teletext dudes are really on the ball aren't they?!?!?! On the day (18/11/98) 
    their C4 mag on p143 announces that Billy Idol is putting some new material 
    in MP3 form on <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a>, 
    Sir William of Idol decides to remove the two tracks he originally 
    submitted!!!! In this message on mp3.com's bbs, it is strongly implied 
    by the admin that Sir Cyberwilly of Idol's label might have been put 
    under a bit of pressure by the American record industry body (RIAA), 
    who at the moment, don't really like MP3!!!! Ah well, all it means is 
    that major labels will be waiting for ages for some proprietary format 
    to be worked out, whilst everyone else will still be using MP3s... Sounds 
    like they're really thinking ahead, huh?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://bboard.mp3.com/ubb/Forum8/HTML/000022.html">http://bboard.mp3.com/ubb/Forum8/HTML/000022.html</a></p>
