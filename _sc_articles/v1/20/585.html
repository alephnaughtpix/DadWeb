<p>You might be tinkering 
    around with that new Lego robot set on Xmas morning, but what you might 
    not know is that you might be doing the same thing as NASA on their 
    next Mars missions!!!!!! The "space dudes" are going to be using robots 
    to 'follow the water' on their next missions!!!!! Er, except of course, 
    that they're not using Lego, at least not last time I looked!!!!! Now 
    you might think that using a robot to 'follow the water' is a bit stupid 
    as the water will "fuse" it's "positronic brain" and put into a "logical 
    failure" or something like that... Well, this robot is a little different!!!! 
    Apparently this one has "eyes" and "ears"!!!!!! So it'll probably be 
    also wearing a nice waterproof macintosh jacket as well!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/space/9812/11/mars.orbiter.launch/index.html">http://cnn.com/TECH/space/9812/11/mars.orbiter.launch/index.html</a></p>
