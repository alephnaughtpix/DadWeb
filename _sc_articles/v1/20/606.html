<p>We're not sure 
    if this is a joke site or not!!!! Still, if you want to "transform your 
    internal architecture", then you might find this site interesting... 
    But I'm not sure about this one!!!!!! What does "transform your internal 
    architecture" actually mean?!?!?! I thought transforming internal archtecture 
    was what they do when they knock down the inside of a building, but 
    leave the outside still standing!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/students/bees_are/Douglas/default.html">http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/students/bees_are/Douglas/default.html</a></p>
