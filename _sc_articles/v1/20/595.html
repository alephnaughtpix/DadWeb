<p>Well, this is a surprise!!!! It's a Y2K "controversy" story, and it doesn't come from 
    the US!!!!!!! In fact, it comes from the UK, so we don't have to hear 
    of loadsa stories about cranky people with weapons stocking up on food!!!!!! 
    Well, not right at the mo anyway, if this story is anything to go by!!!!! 
    Apparently some big Y2K dude in the government is denying that he advised 
    people to stock up on food... Erm, so what was talking about then?!?!?!? 
    There's not many things you can confuse with advice to stockpile food, 
    is there?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_234000/234077.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_234000/234077.stm</a></p>
