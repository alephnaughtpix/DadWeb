<p>As that nice young man Jack Dee once said: car alarms are great- you can now hear when 
    someone's walking near your car!!!!!! Only now with this invention here, 
    you won't just hear an alarm!!!! You'll also hear a massive "foom!!!" 
    and agonised wailing cries of pain!!! No, it's not a car alarm in Baghdad 
    accidentelly mucking up one of those global missile postioning satellites!!!!! 
    In fact, it's a car alarm with built-in flamethrower!!!!!!!!! Apparently 
    the first customer is a policeman or something.</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/">http://cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/</a></p>
