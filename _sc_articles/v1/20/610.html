<p>Well, our radio 
    station <b>Radio East Miton</b> (See <a href="18.html#541"> issue 18</a>...) 
    appears to be packing 'em in!!!!!!! (Well, we think so- actually, our 
    modem's not fast enough to be able to listen to it!!!!!!!) But here's 
    another station on tha W3- for the Playstation!!!!!!!!!! Yes, the Playstation 
    people have done an internetto webby thingy radio station for the Playstation, 
    and they've done some sort of joke thingy with it!!!! I'm presume it 
    was done in the style of David letterman's "Top Tens", because it's 
    not really that much funny at all!!!!</p><pre class="usenet">"Top Ten reasons the PlayStation Underground Radio Network
      is better than radio:

      10. You can listen to it AND watch it.
       9. You can do # 10 while at the office and you'll actually look
          like you're working.
       8. Interviews you won't find anywhere else from the people who
          make your favorite PlayStation games.
       7. Hot, fresh codes hand delivered 24 hours a day for no extra
          charge.
       6. Short attention span? Mind wanders? No worries. You can go
          back and listen to what you missed again. And again. And
          again.
       5. No strange static when you drive under bridges.
       4. Your friends will NEVER come to your house just to listen
          to the radio.
       3. No Emergency Broadcast Service tests--ever.
       2. David Lawrence is your host, and if you can handle it, the
          guys from videogames.com are there to tell you first hand
          what it's all about.
       1. You'll never have to sit through a crummy pop song to find
          out what cool thing is coming up next." </pre><p><a href="http://www.videogames.com/psuradio/">http://www.videogames.com/psuradio/</a></p>
