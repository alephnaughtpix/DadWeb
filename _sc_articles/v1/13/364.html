<p>Apparently The "Big N" delayed plans for their colour edition of the spiffy little 
    brick-shaped console piece of electronics magic that is the Gameboy, 
    (I still thought the Atari Lynx was much better tho!!!) because they 
    wanted to wait until technology actually advanced to the point when 
    the sort of thing they wanted it to do wasn't too expensive to produce!!!! 
    So now they're doing it- but if they waited a few months, they could 
    have used this spiffy little 1280x1024 colour LCD for their display!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.comicro.com/">http://www.comicro.com/</a></p>
