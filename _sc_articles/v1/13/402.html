<p>Well, not really, but scientests seem to think that a couple of the moons of Jupiter, 
    Europa and Callisto, (I didn't know they named a moon after that character 
    in "Xena: Warrior Princess"!!!!!) may have all the building blocks of 
    life!!!!! It's almost like that film "2010"!!!!! Except for the bit 
    about Callisto... And the monolith... OK, nearly everything's different 
    then, apart from the "Europa may have life" bit!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/tim/98/10/22/timfgnusa03007.html?1124027">http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/tim/98/10/22/timfgnusa03007.html?1124027</a></p>
