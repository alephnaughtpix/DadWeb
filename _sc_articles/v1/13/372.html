<p>Can you imagine a spider getting together with a goat to produce an extremely strong 
    material to replace the plastic used in fishing nets?!?!? No, I couldn't 
    either!!!!! But obviously some scientests did!!!!! These dudes from 
    Quebec are putting synthesised spider protiens into goats milk to make 
    ultra strong material called "biosteel"!!! I wouldn't like to be a fly 
    hitting of those webs!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981012/newscien/908150460-202186796.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981012/newscien/908150460-202186796.html</a></p>
