<p>Well, you spotty Linux nerd-geek-anorack-propeller-heads (As Future Publishing might 
    say!!!) will no doubt be on the lookout for new gamez to stick on your 
    Ultra-Stealth-Ninja PC "box" which will test the 3D hardware a bit more 
    than a console text display!!!!! Unfortunately one of the early ones 
    didn't last very long- which might have something to do with the fact 
    that the object of the game was to kill priests!!!!! Now there's a linux 
    game called Sin!!!! So we'll probably get some "expose" by the Daily 
    Mail two years from now about an "evil computer cult" called "Linox" 
    because of this!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/sin/">http://www.linuxgames.com/sin/</a></p>
