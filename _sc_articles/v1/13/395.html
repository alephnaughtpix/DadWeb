<p>Now, thanks to the wonder of Java, you can now see the cream of America's unfunny comics!!! 
    <b>Comic Explorer</b> is a rather nice big Java prog which allows you 
    to select from loadsa comix!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.comiczone.com/explorer/">http://www.comiczone.com/explorer/</a></p><p>It's not just a gimmicky thingy though- apparently it uses a neato 
    thingy called "<b>Thinkmap</b>" which is supposed to be a really good 
    way of sorting data by pulling levers or something.</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15703.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15703.html</a></p>
