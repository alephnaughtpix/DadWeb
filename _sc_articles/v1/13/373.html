<p>So, how old are your records?!?!?! 10, 20, 30 year old?!?!?!? Well, some crew called 
    the "Mayans" have a record that is over a thousand years old!!!!!! Obviously 
    this dates from the time before gramophones, so it's not available on 
    CD!!!!! In fact, it's in the extremely unportable form of a big cave!!!!! 
    These clever Mayan dudes actually carved the inside parts of the cave 
    in such as way that if you make a noise, the echo that comes back is 
    actually a recording of a bird from the local area!!!!!!! Pretty neat, 
    huh??!?!? I would like to see them try and emulate a record by Fatboy 
    Slim, tho!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981012/newscien/908150460-202186796.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981012/newscien/908150460-202186796.html</a></p>
