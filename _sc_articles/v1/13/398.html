<p>You know that 
    motor show in Birmingham that the lady from "Watchdog" wasn't allowed 
    into?!?!? Well, one of the things at the show was a car- with voice 
    activated car controls!!!!! Luckily, only-non driving stuff can be voice 
    controlled (eg the radio, so you can tell Chris Evans to belt it!!!!), 
    but I still don't like to think how the car will behave if the driver 
    has some of that new-fangled "road rage" stuff!!!!!! You could probably 
    recognise all the angry drivers in a traffic jams, as their inside lights 
    would probably be switching on and off in response to their naughty 
    words!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981021/hitech/908989857-19981021ai.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981021/hitech/908989857-19981021ai.html</a></p>
