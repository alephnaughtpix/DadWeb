<p>If you're in jail, and your release date is December 31st 1999, then you're probably 
    going to feel really cheesed off!!!! Why!?!? Well, just a few hours later, 
    the rest of the criminal establishment may be let out!!!! This is because 
    there are fears that some embedded systems in jails may mess up due to 
    the millenium bug, and loads of criminals might break out as a result!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/15627.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/15627.html</a></p>
