<p>Imagine for a moment that you actually are in the world of Mario 64, jumping around 
    and rescuing penguins or something, and then suddenly from nowhere, 
    someone plays "Because We Want To" by Billie!!!! What would you do?!?!?</p><p>Well, you would of course say: "Aha!!! I must be in Waikiki in Hawaii!!!!!" 
    this would be because that's where the world's first virtual nightclub 
    is expected to be opened!!!!!! The one thing I don't understand is 
    why they put an exciting virtual nightclub world in Hawaii!!!! Surely 
    it would be better to open in somewhere not very exciting, like Bolton!!!!!!!
