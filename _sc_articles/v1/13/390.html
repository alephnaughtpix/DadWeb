<p>Some of you young 
    sprites might be aware that "retro" synth noises are back in fashion 
    in the music biz!!!! Loadsa little boxes have been launched emulating 
    303s, 808s, 505s, 101s, and even the rare 123456789-0-123456789s!!!!! 
    But only now has it happened to one of the most popular "retro" synths 
    ever!!!!! No, I'm not talking about the Minimoog, or even the Mediumsizedmoog, 
    but the SID soundchip on the Commodore 64 home computer!!!!!! Yes, that's 
    right- someone's done a MIDI rackmounted box that faithfully emulates 
    the SID chip!! That means that soon you'll be able to hear dance records 
    with the distinctive "musical wasp trapped in a pipe and put through 
    a phaser" sound of the SID!!!!! Maybe there might even be an "old-skool" 
    type Rob Hubbard revival?!?!? (Now that *<b>would</b>* be really neat!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.sidstation.com/">http://www.sidstation.com/</a></p>
