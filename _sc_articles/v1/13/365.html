<p>Well, some people might be new to packet-radio internet connection, but we aren't!!!!!! 
    (See <a href="12.html#359"> issue 12</a>...) So here's another one- apparently some people 
    in San Jose are setting up a "UHF" radio connection wheeze!!!! Funny thing is... I thought 
    UHF was the frequency rage they broadcast the TV on!!!!!! Won't that muck up the telly 
    pictures in the area?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://computernewsdaily.com/live/Latest/259_091697_112207_9941.html">http://computernewsdaily.com/live/Latest/259_091697_112207_9941.html</a></p>
