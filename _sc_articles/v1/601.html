<p>When you have 
    a nice bit of fish and chips, when you're just about to eat a chip, 
    do you think: "This could represent the future computing!!!!!"?!?! 
    Well, after this story, you might!!!!! That's because this lot are getting 
    to make the first ever whole computer thingy on a single chip!!!!!! 
    Does that mean a powerful parallel processing array of computers will 
    in future look like a bag of chips?!?!?!?!??!</p><p><a href="http://www.eet.com/story/OEG19981211S0011">http://www.eet.com/story/OEG19981211S0011</a></p>
