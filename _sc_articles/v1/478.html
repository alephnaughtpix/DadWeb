<p>Well, as they 
    keep saying, "Only In America!!!!" And one thing that's really popular 
    only in America is suing the "ass" off people whom cause you "traumatic 
    distress" (ie you disagree with them!!!!)!!!!! So instead of young people 
    wanting to grow up and be an atomic physicist, or writer of ITV situation 
    comedy, they're wanting to be a lawyer!!!!!!!! Or at least, this lot 
    are!!!!!!!!!!!! They're called <b>Future Lawyers Alliance Network (FLAN)</b>!!!!!! 
    So, have a look here at their highly entertaining newsletter, and get 
    the "FLAN" in your face!!!! (Doh!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~flan_news/front.html">http://members.tripod.com/~flan_news/front.html</a></p>
