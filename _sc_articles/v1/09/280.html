<p>What with the business with Bill Clinton, it seems no-one's safe, even the
    mighty Bill Gates!!!!!! Micrsoft are apparently "troubled" by a new
    unofficial "expose" book that details a whole load of allegations like
    bugging competiters, dirty business practices, and oddly enough, no
    sex orgies!!!!
  <p>Faced with this obviously disgusting and depraved book, MS might actually
    *<b>not</b>* be suing!!!! <i>"When there is a book that is so full of
    inaccuracies and falsehood, do you only bring more attention to it by filing
    some sort of legal action?"</i> they say...
