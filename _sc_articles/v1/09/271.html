<p>Monica Lewinsky!!! 
    Kenneth Star!!!! President Clinton!!! Iraqi chemical weapons!!! Osama 
    Bin Laden!!!! Sorry about that folks, but I'm just increasing our readership 
    there!!!! After the news about the NSA having super-duper hardware and 
    software to monitor email going in and out of the US for special "key" 
    phrases, (See <a href="6.html#179"> issue 6</a>...) it looks like the 
    FBI are getting together a similar little system of their own!!!! 
  <p>So there you are!!!! As well as all the link exchange schemes, submissions
    to search engines, you can increase readership of your website by alluding
    to "naughty" things!!!! I expect the UK secret services must have their
    equivalent... Erm, Tony Blair in sex orgy?!?!?! (I don't think they'll be
    fooled by that one, perhaps!!!!)
