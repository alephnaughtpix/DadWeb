<p>Remember that film "The Boys from Brazil"!??! Wasn't it a stupid name?!?!? I
    mean, it was about some plot by Josef Mengeles to clone loadsa Hitlers, it
    wasn't about blokes from Brazil, because they were actually all
    German!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, I was vaguely reminded of the film when I read this story about this
    genetic doctor bloke from Chicago. Not that he's a Nazi who experimented on
    living humans in a Nazi death camp or anything like that, he's just wanting
    to clone himself!!! His wife is to carry the cloned embryo!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/health/090698/healtht_12144.html">http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/health/090698/healtht_12144.html</a></p>
