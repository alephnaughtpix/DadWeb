<p>Looks like a certain infamous recent debate in the House of Lords has weighed
    heavily on the consciences on some of the priveledged senior citizens!!!! One
    Lord speaking on a compeletely different subject started off his speech by
    complaining that someone had broken into the House of Lords website and put
    some "disgusting" porno piccies on it!!!! Only one problem tho- no-one else
    noticed any "naughty" stuff on the website before or after he said
    anything!!!!</p><p>Hmmm, well, obviously he wouldn't be mixing his bookmarks up or anything
    like that, so maybe there's a porno "soundalike" equivalent for the House
    of Lords, a bit like <a href="http://www/whitehouse.com/">http://www/whitehouse.com/</a> !!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/090498/info6_11005_noframes.html">http://www.techserver.com/newsroom/ntn/info/090498/info6_11005_noframes.html</a></p>
