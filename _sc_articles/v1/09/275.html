<p>Just as well I didn't tell that "Linux Babylon" story (See <a href="8.html#238"> issue 
    8</a>...) this week, as it wouldn't have been so funny!!!!!!! That's 
    because it turns out that the makers of the game dev system for Linux 
    have discovered that someone already has used the name "Babylon"!!! 
    They're now changing their name to "Babel", and they've also changed 
    their homepage!!!! However, I wouldn't be too surprised if someone's 
    already used "Babel"... I mean, we're talking about something that suggests 
    either "Tower of Babel" (Which was a rather good little game in the 
    early 90s for the Atari ST!!!) or the "Babel-fish" in the "Hitchhikers 
    Guide To The Galaxy"!!! (Which also was used recently by AltaVista- 
    see <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/</a>) 
    So, not really too much room for manouvere there!!!! 
  <p>Let's hope they find some name to settle down with, as their actual idea is pretty neat anyway!!!
