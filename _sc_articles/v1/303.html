<p>Have you ever thought: "Lots of people say I'm on another planet completely!!!!!
    But I wonder what it would be like to be *<b>really</b>* on another planet?!?!?"
    Well, such a thought been never far from my mind!!!!!! But a whole load of
    astronomers must be thinking the same thing, because they're trying to find
    planets around other stars!!! And they've hit on the original idea that:
    <i>"To look at the planet you need to get rid of the starlight"</i>!!!!!!!!
    Cor, these dudes are really brainy!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15113.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15113.html</a></p>
