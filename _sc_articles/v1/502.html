<p>Remember our very first issue?!?!?!?! Well if you don't, then on
    one of the stories, (See <a href="1.html#26"> issue 1</a>...) we were
    telling you about a really spiffy idea- an open source MP3 player!!!!
    Well, you might ask, what the four fruit marmalade happened to the
    dashed program?!??!?! In fact, it's done really well!!!!! In fact,
    one of the big "noises" of internet music, <b>Goodnoise</b>, has given
    it some backing- and it's still open source!!!! From a commercial
    company?!?!?! Will wonders never cease?!?!?!? We wonder if this has
    anything to do with Goodnoise joining together with other MP3-using
    companies to promote the MP3 format... (See <a href="15.html#432"> issue
