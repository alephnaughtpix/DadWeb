<p>Well, one of the albums that's playing a lot at SDHQ has been "Fantasma" by
    some Japanese dude who for some reason reason calls himself <b>Cornelius</b>,
    after one of the characters in "Planet of the Apes", and refers to himself
    in the album credits as "The Ape"!!!!!!! It's a fabby little album which shows
    up all those tepid attempts at "dance/indie" crossovers for the load of
    patronising guitary bollox that they really are!!!!!! Our favourite is the one
    where he plays some old Bach tune on a whole load of little bleepy instruments,
    over a whole load of really fast breakbeats!!!!! Mind you, the one where he
    plays Kraftwerk's "Numbers" as a punk song is pretty neat as well!!!!!!!!</p><p>So we're quite glad to find out that someone's got a fan page for the Japanese pop
    star who appears to be inspired by the Beach Boys and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain!!! We
    think there really ought to be more Japanese pop stars inspired by the Beach Boys
    and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain!!!</p><p><a href="http://207.51.134.2/~donk/cornelius/index.html">http://207.51.134.2/~donk/cornelius/index.html</a></p>
