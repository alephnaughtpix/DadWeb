<p>Well, you might have fiddled with a mouse, or even twiddled with a Twiddler!!!!
    (See <a href="13.html#367"> issue 13</a>...) But here's a new computer input
    device!!!!! It's not really got a name, but it's referred to as a "pen-like
    device"!!!!! Does that mean if it doesn't work, you can write a letter with
    it to the manufacturers to ask for a replacement?!?!?!??!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981119/newscien/911433660-1812660">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981119/newscien/<br/>
