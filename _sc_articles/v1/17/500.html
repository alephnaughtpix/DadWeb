    Anyone remember that funny political ezine, "<b>Scotland The Raw</b>", 
    that was intending to be a mighty Scottish equivalent of Private Eye, 
    and was launched with great fanfare in the Ecosse section of the Sunday 
    Times, (See <a href="3.html#59"> issue 3</a>...) released a rather uneven 
    debut issue a week late (See <a href="4.html#112"> issue 4</a>...) on 
    a mailing list, after which both websites disappeared, (See <a href="5.html#163"> 
    issue 5</a>...) only resurfacing briefly when we started sniffing around!!!! 
    (See <a href="7.html#217"> issue 7</a>...)</p><p>Well, the Gamerush URL may still be down, but the
    <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> is back up!!!!! Only, it points to
    a rather different site- The "<b>Unoffical Diablo II Site</b>"!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a></p><p>And just in case, they read this, (Well- you never know!!!!!) we
    have the photografik evidence!!!! Check this out!!!!</p><p><a href="graphics/str/diablo.jpg">http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/~mjames/<br/>
