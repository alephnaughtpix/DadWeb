<p>Well, it looks like those "strong words" between Microsoft and RealNetworks (See
    <a href="4.html#106"> issue 4</a>...) have finally ended!!!! Microsoft are selling
    all their shares in RealNetworks!!!!!! Somehow I don't think you'll be hearing
    any adverts for Windows 2000 in any RealAudio shows any day soon!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/16353.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/16353.html</a></p>
