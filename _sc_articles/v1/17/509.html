<p>Well, here's an interesting piece of a news I saw on the Planet Rock news section
    on C4 Teletxt (p481)!!!! Apparently Tony Scott is producing a TV series based on
    that funny vampire movie he made in the early 80s called "The Hunger"!!!!!! And
    the main star of that film, David Bowie is apparently to host each episode!!!!
    We saw this news repeated on the gossip section of Club 140 (p143), adding that
    it's going to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel, so it must be true!!!!!!</p><p>We wonder if it'll be anything like this series we've seen on the Sci-Fi channel
    over the past year... Oddly enough, it's also called "The Hunger", and it's
    based on the film by Tony Scott, but this one is actually produced by *<b>all</b>*
    the Scott brothers, including Ridley and Jake as well as Tony, and it's hosted
    by Terence Stamp not David Bowie, so it can't possibly be the same series, can
    it!??!? And having seen the series, we say: just as well, because the one we've
    seen isn't really very good!!!! And this reviewer person agrees with us!!!!</p><p><a href="http://detnews.com/SCREENS/9707/18/hunger/hunger.htm">http://detnews.com/SCREENS/9707/18/hunger/hunger.htm</a></p><p>No doubt with this new David Bowie series coming out, a lot of silly people are
    going to get confused with the existing Terence Stamp one, and we can't have
    that!!! So here's an episode guide for the not-so-good series!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.crl.com/~rad/hunger.txt">http://www.crl.com/~rad/hunger.txt</a></p>
