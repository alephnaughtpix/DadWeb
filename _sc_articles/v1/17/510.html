<p>As any of you might know, work has started on that lovely little space station up
    in, erm, space!!!!!!! Apparently when it's finished, you'll be able to see it
    from Earth!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iss/newsid_218000/218295.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iss/newsid_218000/218295.stm</a></p><p> Which is just as well, because that that spiffy Ion rocket we talked about 
    before (See <a href="14.html#412"> issue 14</a>...) started off working 
    really well, then a very short time later, stopped working altogether, 
    and they don't know why!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deepspace981111.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deepspace981111.html</a></p>
