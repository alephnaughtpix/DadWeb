<p>You know those really great little "cats eyes" they stick in the road?!?!?!
    Well, whenever I drive down the motorway in my Ford Edsel, I'm certainly glad
    of their presence!!!!! Well, there's now going to be cats eyes with brains
    now!!! They're getting called "Intelligent Road Studs" for some reason!!!!!!
    So not only are they smart, but they're "studs" as well!!!!!! I suppose we'll
    next be making cats eyes that go "miaow", and are powered by
    Kit-e-Kat!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981118/newscien/911347260-2215272529.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981118/newscien/<br/>
