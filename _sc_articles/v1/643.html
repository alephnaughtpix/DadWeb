    that installing a printer on your compute was really boring!!!!! Well, 
    you'd be wrong!!!!!! This lot have made a flippin' ballet out of it!!!!!!! 
    Check out this exciting webpage called <i>"Installing a network PostScript 
    printer on a Sun workstation running SunOS, as illustrated through interpretive 
    dance."</i> So, not only are these dudes educating you about networks 
    and printers, they're also expanding your artistic horizons!!!!!!!!
