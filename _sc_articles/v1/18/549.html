<p>Well, now we know that this flippin' cliched "portal" business has finally
    hit the bottom of it's nadir, all by itself!!!!!! And here's the evidence!!!!!!
    Some 11 year-old has started a portal service, and is becoming reasonably
    successful with it, and this story gives a "little whizzkid really really
    shows it to the grow-ups!!" spin!!!!! </p><p>The thing is, if the average kid can run a successful portal, then what's
    so flippin' special about the "big" portals run by massive companies?!?!?!?!?! We
    say, well done to the 11 year old for cutting through all this flippin'
    "portal" hype!!!! </p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981130/commtouch__1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981130/commtouch__1.html</a></p>
