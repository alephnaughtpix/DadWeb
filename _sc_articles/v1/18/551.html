<p>Well, it's been some time since we mentioned that other spiffy push invention, <b>Zing!</b>!!!! 
    (See <a href="10.html#312"> issue 10</a>...) The idea of viewing spiffy 
    animated bits whilst you're loading a webpage, and loading the animations 
    whilst you're not "doing" anything on the net is a still really great 
    idea, but apart from the increasingly "fnarr fnarr!!!!" French language 
    serial, (See <a href="13.html#387"> issue 13</a>...) the content provided 
    by the Zing! channels is still pretty duffo to say the least!!!!!! But 
    one thing has changed!!!! We said before that if Zing! allowed users 
    to create their own content, then things would improve rapidly- and 
    they've done it!!!!! Well, almost!!!!! Users can create their own Zing! 
    channel with JPEGs and/or Shockwave Flash anims either form the web, 
    or their own HD!!!!!</p><p>Only one prob- unlike Pointcast's user channels, which allows users to put their
    channels on tha w3 for other users to download into the viewer, and always checks
    for updated content or channel data on the net, the Zing! channel only remains on
    the users HD as a part of some config textfile!!! If we wanted to broadcast our
    own Senior Dads Zing! channel, we'd have to take the bit of the config file with
    our stuff on it, and tell viewers to cut and paste it into their own config
    file!!!!! Not very user-friendly, eh?!?!?! And there's no way to telling the
    channel to update, short of telling the user to select "Update now" from the menu
    every so often!!!!</p><p>So, it'll take a bit more updating in program terms before Zing! really becomes
    a hit, we think!!! But they're moving in the right direction!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zing.com/">http://www.zing.com/</a></p>
