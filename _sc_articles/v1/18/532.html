<p>If you want to see what people are saying about the big filmz (!!!) that
    are happening over in the US over the pond, then you might be interested
    in this webby-sitey!!!!! It's one of those new generation of funny little
    news sites like Slashdot and Newstrolls, where most of the stuff is written
    by the regular readers rather than an editorial team... Only in this case,
    it's movie reviews that are written!!!!!!!! It's a bit like the reviews
    part of <b>Ain't It Cool News</b>, only you don't have any introductions by
    Harry Knowles saying how cool he thinks it is!!!!!!</p><p>Only one problem tho- the people behind this site are obviously fans of the
    Prodigy, as they've decided to call the site "<b>Hollywood Bitchslap</b>"!!!!
    We expect the Beastie Boys will be emailing them about this!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://hollywoodbitchslap.com/">http://hollywoodbitchslap.com/</a></p>
