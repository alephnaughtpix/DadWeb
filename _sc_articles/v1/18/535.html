<p>No doubt, you're 
    probably absolutely sick of hearing the news that your Netscape browsey-wowsey 
    has become an AOL browsey-wowsey!!!!! (You'll probably now be getting 
    "Free!!!! 1 month on AOL!!!! Give us your credit details please in case 
    we decide to take money off you!!!!!" disks hanging of the browser now!!!!!!) 
    Quite a few "Slashdot" type people are thinking about moving to a different 
    browsey-wowsey from the "big two"... We've already mentioned the latest 
    version of Opera recently, (See <a href="17.html#517"> issue 17</a>...) 
    but here's one for all you Linux geek-nerd propellor-head Star Wars 
    fans!!!!!! It's called "Mnmemnomnic", apparently because it's "modular" 
    or something...</p><p>I think they ought to call it different name tho, as Mnmenmomninc is a really
    difficult name to spell!!!!! If they're reading I suggest that instead of
    Mnmemnmnemnmnonmnic (Damn!!!!!), they call it "<b>FLiB</b>", which is short
    for "<b>F</b>abby <b>Li</b>nux <b>B</b>rowsey-wowsey"!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mnemonic.org/">http://www.mnemonic.org/</a></p>
