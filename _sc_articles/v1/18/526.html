<p>Now this is a bit of a bummer!!!!! The lovely site at 
    <a href="http://www.ml.org/">http://www.ml.org/</a> , where we got our 
    <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> 
    name from, are not going back online on Dec 5 as they promised!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="17.html#503"> issue 17</a>...) In fact, they're shutting down!!!!!! 
    Apparently they've run out of money or something lame like that.... So, luckily
    for us that <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> 
    has started working again!!! We're also looking for other redirect services...
