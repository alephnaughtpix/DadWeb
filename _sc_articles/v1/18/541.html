<p>Well, for us, the real find of the fortnight has been <b>Imagine Radio</b>, who
    are an Internet Radio station with a bit of difference!!!!!! They've got
    together with a whole load of various different types of radio stations, and
    pooled all their playlists together to create a mega-playlist of zillions of
    styles!!!!! So bleepin' what you might think, but the really smart thing is
    that you can register your own free account with them, and have your own
    internet radio station with a customised playlist made up from the
    mega-playlist!!! You can choose general genres from the various radio
    stations, but you can also go down to a more detailed level, and select/deselect
    individual artists in your personal playlists!!!!! Even better, you can make
    your customised station public, and let others listen to it!!!!!!!</p><p>The Realaudio soundquality is pretty AM-like, but you actually get all of the
    song, and not just a clip of it!!!!! Sometimes, you even get the album or
    12-inch (Ooh-err crikey Vicar!!!) version of the song, rather than the
    "radio edit"!!!! (Isn't that ironic!!!) All that's missing now is having an
    automatic smartarse DJ blabbering all over the end of each record, and
    custom cheesy radio jingles!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.imagineradio.com/">http://www.imagineradio.com/</a></p><p>Well, as you might guess, us Senior Dads like being on the cutting edge of
    technology, so we've started our own station!!!!! Yes!!!!!! The Senior Dads
    own Internet Radio Station, <b>Radio East Milton</b>, was launched at 5pm on
    25th November 1998!!!! Just as quiet as the Digital TV launch, but with
    better content!!!! If you've gotta mega-fast netty webby connection, listen
    to Radio East Milton!!! OK, most of you probably won't be able to listen to
    it, but you can go to the homepage, and find out what exciting records are
    played on our station!!!</p><p><a href="http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/~mjames/senior/radio/">http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/~mjames/senior/radio/</a></p>
