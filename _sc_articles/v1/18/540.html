<p>Well, here's an 
    internet music story that's also a non-MP3 story, amazingly enough!!!! 
    At least, it's a non-MP3 story, according to the <b>Internet Underground 
    Music Archive</b>, a really old internet site devoted to exposing (Oooh 
    blimey missus!!!!!!) new musical talent, who have done a rather big 
    report on the affect the Internet will have on music!!!!! No, they don't 
    say that music on the Internet makes you more depressed!!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="8.html#239"> issue 8</a>...) In fact, they say the internetty 
    webby thingy will revolutionise the way music is distributed- which 
    by an interesting coincidence, would make IUMA a major player, as they, 
    well, distribute music on the Internet!!!!!! 
  <p>But that's not all!!!! Apparently, MP3 is *<b>not</b>* going to be the major
    format used on the Internet!!!!!!! Which is jolly lucky for IUMA, as all the
    the full length songs in their archives appear to be in Realaudio or Liquid Audio
    format!!!!!!
