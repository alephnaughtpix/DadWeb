<p>Remember that old bloke in the Whitehouse not so long ago!!! The delightful old
    movie actor one that soaid such great things like "Where would this land be without
    this great country of ours!??!?" and "The bombing begins in 5 minutes!!!"?!?!?!
    Yes, I'm of course, referring to Ronald Reagan!!!!! One of his great ideas at the
    time was this thingy called "Star Wars", which apparently had nothing at all to
    do with the film, but was about zapping satellites and missile with big laser
    guns and stuff!!!!! A lot of people for some reason found this idea extremely
    funny!!!!! But the really funny thing is that according to this story, by the
    time the next "Star Wars" comes out, the Chinese might have a laser weapon to zap
    out satellites!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://search.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19981128/V000792-112898-idx.html">http://search.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WAPO/19981128/V000792-112898-idx.html</a></p>
