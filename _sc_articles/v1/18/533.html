<p>Have you ever been surfing on the supey-dupey infopipe highway web, and thought
    to yourself: <i>"Wouldn't it be really handy if I could keep tabs on how long
    there is to go before the Earth is engulfed in a cataclysmic nuclear conflict!!!!"</i>?!?!?! 
    Well, now you can find out!!!!! This very useful site keeps clocks on various
    deadlines, such as the Linux Y2.038K bug, and the "Doomday Clock"!!!!! I dunno
    how they measure the Doomday Clock tho!!!! Do they call the US Pentagon and
    say <i>"When are you going to start the nuclear war then!??!?!?"</i>!??!?!? 
    And do the Pentagon say: "Oh we've pencilled it in
    for a Wednesday in March 2132, but keep it quiet, will you!!!!!!!!!"</p><p><a href="http://www.panaga.com/clocks/clocks.htm">http://www.panaga.com/clocks/clocks.htm</a></p>
