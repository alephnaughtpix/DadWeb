<p>Well, we've had Disneyland, Blobbyworld, Itchy &amp; Scratchy World, and
    even Dolly Parton's opened her own place called "Dollywood"!!! (Which
    presumably has two really big "hills" in it!!!) Now, we're going to have a
    whole theme park devoted to reggae <b>Bob Marley</b>!!! We don't know
    exactly what they've got planned for it, but expect they're be loads of
    "little birds" about the place, you'll be able to go on a rollercoaster
    called "The Wailers", you'll be able to get to get "Jammin" jam from the
    souvenier shop (Along with funny shaped cigarettes!!!!), and if you're a bloke 
    and you've got no woman with you, you'll
    not be allowed to cry!!!! We think there'll be "One Love" for this theme park, and there
    won't be any mass "Exodus" from it!!!! (DOH!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/template/World-Template.idc?artid=19981124020739033&amp;top=world&amp;template=Default.htx&amp;maxfieldsize=720">http://www.scmp.com/news/template/World-Template.idc?artid=19981124020739033<br/>
