<p>Well, seeing how the 80s are suddenly back in fashion and everyone's pretending
    that they really liked Culture Club and A Flock of Seagulls all along, it
    obviously won't be too long before the early 90s are back in fashion!!!!!! So
    why not get their before anyone else by visiting this site, which is all about
    one of the classic early 90s fashion statements- the fractal thingy!!!! Yes,
    with "<b>Sprott's Fractal Gallery</b>", you can remember the times when all those
    "Mandlebrots" and "Julias" were staring out from the cover of zillions of
    "Ambient House" compilations!!!! In fact, you can even re-create the sound as
    well, because the website also features random "fractal" MIDI music on the
    pages!!! Now, all that's left is for the webmaster to call himself "Juan" or
    something.</p><p><a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals.htm">http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fractals.htm</a></p>
