<p>A few more of our reader peeps probably have stuck Linux on one of their old
    computers by now, so here's a new one for you!!!! <b>Trinux</b> is like Linux- only
    smaller!!!! It fits on 3 flopy disks, and says in RAM all the time, just like an old
    Amiga 500 system!!!! Apparently this is really handy for portable systems or something
    like that!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.trinux.org/">http://www.trinux.org/</a></p>
