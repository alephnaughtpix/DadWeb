<p>One interesting idea that we thought was a bit ahead of it's time was this
    <b>Push Media</b> business that was being hyped a year or two ago!!!! Unlike
    the "portal" business, we thought it was a bit better!!!!! Generally, what
    happens is that you call a "push" provider, and download the latest webpages
    from your favourite "channels", and you can read them offline!!! So you
    could, for example, get all the news from your favourite daily news websites
    automatically, and make up your own customised offline internet "newspaper"!!!!
    Unfortunately, despite some good push stuff, and even some hype from Micosoft,
    with their "Active Channels" stuff in IE, there were loads of competing
    proprietary standards, and the "best thing since slice bread" style hype didn't exactly
    do any favours either!!!!</p><p>Anyway, one of the good ones was <b>Pointcast</b>, which allowed users to make their
    own channels!!!! The main prob with it was that the choice of "proper" channels was a
    bit US biased to say the least!!!!! Until now!!!! Or soon anyway!!!! Pointcast are
    now putting together a UK versh!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.pointcast.co.uk/">http://www.pointcast.co.uk/</a></p>
