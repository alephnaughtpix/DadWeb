<p>Imagine if you saw a webpage with a picture of Thora Hird on it, and from
    the sound speakers you suddenly hear: "<b>PHHHWWWOOAAR!!!!!!!!</b>" Well,
    that's what this lot are working on!!!!!!! Moves are already being made for
    a web browser for the blind, (See <a href="13.html#375"> issue 13</a>...)
    but since a lot of websites use graphics, they're now working on a way to
    covert pictures to sound so that blind people can "hear" them!!! We expect
    as soon as the logo to this page is scanned, it'll give out a lot of happy
    noises!!!!! What happens when a piccy of Billie is scanned 
    tho?!?!?! Will it play "Because We Want To", and make the blind people 
    deaf as well?!?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16454.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16454.html</a></p>
