<p>I was in Strathclyde University the weekend before last, "larging" it as they
    say!!! (And, yes, that's partly why the previous ish was a bit late!!!!) One
    of the things in the Union was this converted bar, which played "cheesy disco"
    all the time, so you had all these young whippersnappers with oblong-shaped
    "media" glasses dancing around really rather badly with "ironic" grins to tunes
    that are as old as the hills!!!!!!! What a brilliant and completely original
    idea!!!! OK, perhaps showing "South Park" on the video wall was perhaps taking
    things a bit too far, and I definately showed them up in the dancing stakes
    when Tight Fit's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" came on!!!!!!
    But apart from that, it was really "ironic" and "postmodern"!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>So I was pleased to hear of this rather fabby idea!!!!!!! An Internet Radio
    show devoted to cheesy disco!!!!!! OK, the website looks a little like a
    Realaudio-encoded Sinclair Spectrum display, but it's a great idea for a netweb
    siteweb!!!! You'll need to start wearing rectangular-shaped glasses, and grow
    a goatee beard before listening to it tho!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.discomagic.org/">http://www.discomagic.org/</a></p>
