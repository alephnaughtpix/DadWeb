<p>Now this is a bit interesting... This is one of those funny cameras that can
    "do" 3D images!!!! Usually tho, the cameras need more than one lens, so it
    can, erm, "do" a 3D image!!!!! This one's a bit different tho- it uses a
    funny flash using lights of different frequencies, and measures the different
    frequencies and works out from that how to "do" a 3D piccy!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.inharmonytech.com/venus3d/index.html">http://www.inharmonytech.com/venus3d/index.html</a></p>
