<p>Looks like that that spiffy Ion rocket we talked about before, (See <a href="17.html#510"> 
    issue 17</a>...) the one started off working really well, then a very 
    short time later, stopped working altogether, has now suddenly started 
    working again with no apparent problems, and they don't knwo the reasons 
    why!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/98/ds1engine.html">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/98/ds1engine.html</a></p>
