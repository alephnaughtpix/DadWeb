<p>Well, if there's one surefire way to test for an alien civilisation of advanced
    intelligence, it's to see if they "switch over" when the ads come on!!!! So,
    this is a really clever idea!!!!! The space agency dudes are seriously considering
    selling ad space on the side of a spaceship to Mars!!!!! So if those microbes
    they found in that rock thingy ever evolve into an intelligent lifeform, they'll
    be know where to get their Coca-Cola, or something like that!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_222000/222865.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_222000/222865.stm</a></p>
