<p>You know when some young people say they're going back to their "pad",
    they're usually referring to some indoor rubbish dump with "Trainspotting"
    posters in it that they "hang out" in?!??! Well, if this lot here invite you
    back to their "pad", they'll not mean this at all!!!!! In fact, they'll probably
    want to "digitise" you and stick you into a "Master Control Program" to play
    "games", just like in "<b>Tron</b>"!!!!!!! That's because this "pad" is
    actually a computer!!!!!!! It's some snazzy palm base computer that can
    apparently surf tha netweb or something.</p><p><a href="http://www.cyrix.com/html/emerging/index.htm">http://www.cyrix.com/html/emerging/index.htm</a></p>
