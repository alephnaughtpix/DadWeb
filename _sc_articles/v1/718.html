<p>Have you ever been on the phone to someone really boring who talked a lot, and while they were going on and on, you
    were thinking: <i>"I could have whisked an egg in the time it takes this idiot takes to say
      something!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?! Well, now you do can this!!!!!!!! With a handy new "Ronco" style appliance called
    the "<b>BlenderPhone</b>"!!!!!!!!!! It's erm, a phone with a blender on it!!!!!!! This miracle device will appear on
    the "Howie Mandell" show!!!!!!!!!!! I dunno what that is, but it sounds impressive!!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, I can't wait
    for those clever people to come up with the "HooverShaver"!!!!!!!!!! Funnily enough, a lot of people think I already
    have a HooverShaver, but that's only because my current electric shaver is so
    old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2215782,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2215782,00.html</a></p>
