<p>Well, there's nothing like forward planning!!!!!!!!!! And some dude called 
    <b>Steven Kilston</b> who's involved with NASA in some way, really knows 
    it!!!!!!!!!!! He's designing a superduper fabby-dabby spaceship- and 
    it'll only be completed (If ever!!!!) a very long time from now, when 
    you're dead!!!!!!!! And the mission is so long that when it's finished, 
    the people who will first pilot the ship will be dead as well!!!!!!!! 
    Apparently it's a "generational" spaceship or something.</p><p><a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/go/sections/science/DailyNews/interstellar990114.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/go/sections/science/DailyNews/interstellar990114.html</a></p>
