<p>If you've ever found your newspaper really boring!??!?!?! Have you
    ever wondered if rolling it up very tightly and sticking in an electrical
    socket will make it a bit more interesting??!??! Well, it might be a little
    bit like that in future!!!!!!!! That's because this lot are doing a lot of
    work on *<b>electronic ink</b>*!!!!!!!! This sort of stuff can be put on a
    page, and you can apply an electric signal to it, and the appearance of the
    ink changes!!!!! So it's a bit like a big monitor screen- on a page of
    paper!!!!! This means you could get a paper, and it'll update itself via
    tha netweb!!!!!!! Presumably you'll also be able to play a good game of
    Quake on it as well!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/science/9812/23/electronic.ink.ap/">http://cnn.com/TECH/science/9812/23/electronic.ink.ap/</a></p>
