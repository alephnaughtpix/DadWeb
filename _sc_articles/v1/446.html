<p>Who says "old media" have got it wrong about the net?!??!?!?!?!?! Why, even this week,
    Ted Turner, the big person who runs CNN, Cartoon Network, and that funny TNT film
    channel that seems to show "Forbidden Planet" and "Poltergiest" at least once every month,
    was saying that "content is king- even on the net"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Even on the net?!?!?!?! Wow!!!!!!!!!!! No flies on this person!!!!!!! So whenever you're
    falling asleep ater watching one of those umpteen adverts which tell you that CNN is available
    in some hotel in New Zealand or something, remember that content is king- even on the net!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2156597,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2156597,00.html</a></p>
