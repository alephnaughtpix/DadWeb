<p>These days, you don't hear bits of chalk being screeched across an old blackboard!!!!!
    Instead, you hear big marker pens being screeched across whiteboards!!!!!! And you still
    can't read them!!!!! But, don't worry- your computer can!!!!! Or at least, it can using this
    spiffy new whiteboard, which is touch-sensitive, and can link up with a computer to make an
    "interactive computer presentation", where you project the computer screen on the whiteboard,
    then draw on the whiteboard- and it draws on the computer screen!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.microtouch.com/ibid/ibid600.htm">http://www.microtouch.com/ibid/ibid600.htm</a></p>
