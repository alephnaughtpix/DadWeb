<p>If you're applying for a job at a big company, and they require you to take
    a urine test for HIV, don't worry!!!!! They might not be testing to see if
    you put "it" about a lot, they might just be checking to see if you're a
    20-a-day man, or an old hippy burn-out!!!!!!!! This is because there's this
    HIV1 urine test, which can also at the same time test for tobacoo and drugs
    use!!!! Of course, if you've got the HIV2 virus instead of HIV1, then you're
    okay!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981008/calypte_bi_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981008/calypte_bi_1.html</a></p>
