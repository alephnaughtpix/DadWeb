<p>Well, here's a new 
    buzzword!!!!!!! You've heard of "wearables" by now... If not, read some 
    old issues of this organ NOW!!!! So here's one for you wearables fans- 
    *<b>augmented reality</b>*!!!! It's just like normal reality expect than 
    you can see extra stuff via your wearable computers... So it's a bit 
    like that dude in "The Terminator" then!!!!!!! </p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15703.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/15703.html</a></p><p>Unfortunately as you might have noted in Star Trek, if you wear 
    a comm-badge, then Captain Jean Luc-pIcard can tell where you are!!!!! 
    So some people are worried that wearing a wearable might allow people 
    to pinpoint where you are!!!! Well, why not do like the Star Trek 
    people with their comm badge, and just toss it off somewhere?!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15745.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15745.html</a></p>
