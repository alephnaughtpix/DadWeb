<p>No, our keyboards 
    not gone wonky!!!!!!! What we mean is that the bloody S**r W**s trailer 
    everyone keeps going on about was just a trailer to a longer trailer 
    which is 4 mins long, and will appear at the start of next year!!!! 
    Oh flippy, that means another flippin' big download, only it'll be much 
    longer this time, as the trailer's almost twice the length now!!!!! 
    What do you mean "what trailer"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29901,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,29901,00.html?st.ne.ni.lh</a></p>
