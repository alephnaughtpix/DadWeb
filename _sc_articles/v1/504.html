<p>Surfing in the saddle of the megmighty infowebby thingy is all very well, but these days
    you need an HD with 20 gazillion squiglabytes (Or even, "gigaquads"!!!!!) space and a
    Pentium Supey-Dupey Stealth Ninja overclocked at 3 grillion Mzh, which uses the entire
    polar ice-cap as a heat-sink!!!!!!!!!!! (And you thought global warming was just caused by
    fossil fuels, like lead in petrol!!!!) But people with slightly smaller computers might
    be interested in these spiffy developements!!!!! <b>PAndroid</b> emailed us to tell us about
    this nice little webserver for Windows machines that can handle CGI and things. It can't
    handle server-side includes (Like the visitor counter on the website!!!), but then, it's
    doing pretty well for a 42K program!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/tinyweb/">http://www.ritlabs.com/tinyweb/</a>
<p>But, ouch!!!!! My Ears!!!!!! They're hurting from all you young people shouting: "But what
    actually flippin' surfing the web!?!??!?!?!"!!!!!!!!!! Well, you can surf tha W3 using only
    a single floppy disk!!!!!!!! Some of you might be saying at this point: "But, oh great and
    wise Senior Dads, we don't have no ST or Amiga, or indeed any computer from the days when you
    could fit Microsoft Word on a 720K disk!!!!!!!" Well, you don't need one of those, you can "do
    it" (ooh-er!!!!!!!) using a normal PC and a floppy!!!!!!! At least, if it's from this lot...</p>

    concoction for cleaning brass ornaments!!!!!!!!!</p>
