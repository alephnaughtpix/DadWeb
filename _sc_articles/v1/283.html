<p>Did you know that there might be a connection between the stuff that goes
    through your veins might have a connection to a spiffy technology advance
    in screen technology this week?!?! Well, the stuff in your blood apart from
    the blood-cells is called "plasma"!!! And oddly enough this week, advances
    have been made in "plasma" computer displays!!!!! Is there any other
    connection?!?!? Er, I don't think so- but I thought it sounded good!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/98/1025news/plasma.html">http://www.eetimes.com/news/98/1025news/plasma.html</a></p>
