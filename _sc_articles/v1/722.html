<p>Have been to the cinema to watch a film, and in the middle of the film, some
    person in the audience stands up and shouts: <i>"This film's too
    good!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!?!?!?!?</i> Well, it doesn't happen at our Milton Gaumont
    cinema, I can tell you!!!!!!!! In fact, it's usually the opposite!!!!!!!!! Erm,
    anyway!!!! If these people in this article are to be believed, in future,
    we'll be complaining about the film looking too good!!!!!!!!!! (I don't see it
    myself somehow!!!!!!!!!!) This is because films are now starting to
    made using digital "film" instead of the usual celloid stuff!!!!!!! And
    already some filmakers are complaining that digital film is too good!!!!!!!!!
    Apparently, it's much more sharp and detailed than celluloid, and apparently
    it doesn't have the "character" of old film, or something vague like
    that!!!!!!! Someone in this article says:</p><blockquote>"If you go into a lamp shop today you'll still find a fair amount of lamps that are still pretending
    like they're candlesticks. But there's no reason an electric light should look
    like a candlestick."!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</blockquote><p>Erm, well.. Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/18176.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/<br/>
