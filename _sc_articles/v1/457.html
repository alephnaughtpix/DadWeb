<p>If someone played the piano on Radio 2, what would you think!??!?!! Well, you might think:
    "Aha! This represents the future of interactive television"!!!!!!!! This is because of some
    clever people at Motorola-land!!!!!! Apparently, they've found that interactive TV can be
    delivered using a wireless and a piano!!!!!!! Using a "very, very interesting band" of the
    radio speccy-trum, and a standard called "Piano", apparently Motorola can broadcast this
    "hot" technology!!!!! Which is ironic, as apparently the antennae for this stuff is the size
    "of a thermostat"!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,4436,2158572,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/zdnn_smgraph_display/0,4436,2158572,00.html</a></p>
