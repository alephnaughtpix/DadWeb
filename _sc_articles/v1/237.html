<p>Ever had one of those days when nothing ever went right?!?!?! Well, it probably
    went better than the dudes at the distinguished computing magazine
    <b>Byte</b>!!!! Their proprietors just turned up and said said: Byte's
    closed, and you're all sacked- you've got one day to clear your desk,
    goodbye!!!! Well, there was probably more to it than that, but it sounds
    just like what happened to me after I produced that documentary
    "The Wonderful Story of Thrash Metal" for Radio 2!!!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, Byte dude and famous science-fiction writer <b>Jerry Pournelle</b>
    (You know, the person who writes stuff with David Niven's son, <b>Larry
      Niven</b>!!!!) has his own site, and on it he's reporting on the various
      ways the writers from Byte are continuing their projects on the amazing
      world wide webby!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.jerrypournelle.com/fiasco.html">http://www.jerrypournelle.com/fiasco.html</a></p><p>Thanks to <b>PAndroid of Page 670</b> for this info!!!
