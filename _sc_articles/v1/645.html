<p>Aren't there some 
    times when you've wanted to bash your head on the keyboard!?!?!? I know 
    it's happened to me!!!! And the odd thing is- most people don't notice 
    the difference in the articles when I do it!!!!!!!! But in future, you 
    might be doing the same thing too- if you're not doing it already!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    That's because this clever bunch of people are starting to work out 
    how to control computers- by the power of the mind!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>All I can say is, I hope they have a "Mindpower Input Level" knob 
    on this thing, for people, such as myself, who have exceptionally 
    powerful minds!!!!!! I wouldn't want to accidentely blow up my computer 
    with my mind!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254621.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254621.stm</a></p>
