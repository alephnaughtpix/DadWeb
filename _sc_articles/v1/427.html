<p>Are Darryl Hall &amp; John Oates the smartest quantum physicists in history?!?!?!?! Well...
    Probably not, but they did call one of their albums "Big Bang Boom" in the 80s, and oddly
    enough, that appears to be how the universe started, it was found this week!!!!!! Images
    from that big Hubble thingy appears to show expansion of the universe in the early days was
    a bit more than it should have been if it was just caused by the Big Bang!!!!! This means
    if there was a Big Bang, there must have been have been an extra "boom" to explain for the
    expansion!!!!!!!!!!!! We expect Hall &amp; Oates will be back soon with their new single "How
    to Accelerate Beyond the Speed of Light"!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="https://www.space.com/52-the-expanding-universe-from-the-big-bang-to-today.html">https://www.space.com/52-the-expanding-universe-from-the-big-bang-to-today.html</a></p>
