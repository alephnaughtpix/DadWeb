<p>Wired News has changed it's look yet again!!!!! (See <a href="4.html#123">issue 4</a>...)
    However, it's only a slight change, as the links colour has been changed to a funny
    shade of blue!!!! Perhaps they are trying to attract more conservative sort of
    reader?!?!?!?!?!?!</p><p>Another thing we've noticed is that they've started dividing longer articles into
    seperate pages, like their old articles in Hotwired!!!!!! Look at this story about
    those two Ant movies...</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16038.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16038.html</a></p>
