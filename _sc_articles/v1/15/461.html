<p>Some of you MP3 fans might have noticed that MP3s files have this very useful little thing
    called an ID3 tag, which allows you to put things like the name of the recording and artist!!!
    Well, I say some of you- in fact, hardly any of you use the bloody things!!!!!!! I still
    keep seeing MP3 files with no ID3 tags, and filenames like "shed_seven-boring_toss.mp3"
    abound!!!!!!! Anyway, for the small minority who actually do use it, you'll soon have a really spiffy
    new version of the tag called <b>ID3v2</b>!!!! What's really neat-o is that you can stick in
    pictures and karaoke style lyrics!!!!!!!! presumably you can even insert another MP3 into
    the tag, but that would be really silly, wouldn't it!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, here's the really
    really really detailed specification for it... Look for the "TMED" "media type" setting!!!!
    You can say in your MP3 file whether it was tranferred from a wax cylinder or an 8-track
    cartridge!!!!!! Which is really useful, what with my record collection!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/id3v2/id3v2.3.0.txt">http://www.lysator.liu.se/id3v2/id3v2.3.0.txt</a></p>
