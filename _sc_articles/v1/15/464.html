<p>Yes, it really is stupid!!!!!!!! Why?!?!?! Well, apparently if you want to do artificial
    intelligence, apparently "neural networks" are the thing to be trying!!!!!!!!! And apparently
    they work better if you do it on an *<b>analogue</b>* computer!!!!!! So digital technology
    by comparision is stupid!!!!!!!!!!!! What's interesting is that the bods here say that
    neural technology based on analogue computer can finally allow the implementation of a really
    old machine technique invented by that Alan Turing person, back in the days of black and white
    TV!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19981103S0017">http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19981103S0017</a></p>
