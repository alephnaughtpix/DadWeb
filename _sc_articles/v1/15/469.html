<p>When I was a young man, there was this really glamourous young maiden from the movies called
    Hedy Lammar!!!!!!!!! No, she wasn't Mark Lammar's mum, she was someone
    completely different, and anyway, she was a talented film actress and inventor!!!
    Erm, anyway!!!!! She's suing Corel software because they put a likeness of
    her on the cover of Corel Draw 8, without her permission!!!! A lot of
    people are surprised to how "aggressive" Corel are at defending
    themselves!!!!! What they might forget is that Hedy Lammar also sued Mel
    Gibson after he did that character called *<b>Hedly</b>* Lammar in the film
    "Blazing Saddles"!!!!!! So they're probably just getting back at her
    because she's such an obvious spoilsport!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/16042.html?all">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/16042.html?all</a></p>
