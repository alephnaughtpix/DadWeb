<p>Real surprise of the week was hearing that K-tel, the lovely people who make loads of really
    spiffy compilation gramophones, have teamed up with... <b>Playboy</b>!!!!!!!!! No, they haven't
    launched "Now That's What I Call The Best Scantily Clad Maidens in the World... Ever! (pt 2)"!!!!
    But they have launched an online music store!!!!!! I wonder if they'll sell compilations of
    the dodgy music used on porno films!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/981103/il_playboy_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/981103/il_playboy_1.html</a></p>
