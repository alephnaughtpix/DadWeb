<p>I was at a jolly nice "gig" the other weekend where a lot of young people at Glasgow Uni
    were "getting down" to a couple of really "slammin'" rap music combos!!!!!! But little did I
    know that by doing so I was predicting what Seagate did this week!!!!!!! Why?!?!! Well, they've
    delivered a "big gigs" HD- it stores 50 gigabytes of stuffs!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/corp/vpr/releases/cuch1836.shtml">http://www.seagate.com/corp/vpr/releases/cuch1836.shtml</a></p>
