<p>Some bright spark has decided that a program which is usually used for searching for strands
    of DNA in some sample thingy, where you're supposed to search for strands of DNA in, to search
    for hacker attacks on a computer system!!!!!!! I wonder what would happen if they're using
    this "DNA search" on a system and some hacker releases a virus into the system!!!! Would the
    "DNA strand" be viewed as real DNA or a hacker?!?!?!?!?!?!??!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15905.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/15905.html</a></p>
