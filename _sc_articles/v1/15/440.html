<p>Wow!!!!!! Some of those wacky Americans can be really wacky!!!!!!!!!! This
    week a couple of dudes were arrested for threatening the life of the US pres, who is
    Bill Clinton!!!!!!!!!!! (Just in case you thought it was still George W. Bush!!!!!!!!!)
    OK, get this- what they planned was... putting little cactus thorns with HIV and rabies on
    them into a cigarette lighter, so that when you light something with it, you get zapped by
    the thorns!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that's a bit stupid, isn't it?!??!?!?!?! I mean, what do they
    expect to happen?!?!?! Do they expect the President to be a heavy smoker, and then he goes
    to their neck of the woods, and then ask them if they have a light, and then they go:
    "Sure!!!! Just try this lighter here!!!!! (Huh huh huh!!!!)", and give him the lighter
    with the thorns in it, then he uses it, and get zilched, and goes "Argh!" and
    dies?!?!?!?!??!?!?!</p><p>Somehow I think this is a little unlikely!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/docs/004545.htm">http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/docs/004545.htm</a></p>
