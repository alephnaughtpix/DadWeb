<p>Well, while the record industry people are fighting over the
    various new technologies and what they mean to the transmission
    of music, a new type of music has been launched!!!!!! <b>Free
    Music</b> is a kind of equivalent of those funny "open source"
    thingies you get in the Linux world!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp/">http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp/</a>
<p>Meanwhile, the various possibilities of the net for music
    distribution have been espoused by none other than Todd Rungren,
    the producer of "Bat Out of Hell" and records by Grand Funk
    Railroad!!!!!!! I suppose when he releases his record on the net,
    then it'll be downloaded quicker than a Bat Out of Hell!!!!!!</p>
