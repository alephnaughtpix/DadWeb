<p>What would you do if there was a major atmospheric storm which disrupted satellite and
    broadcast communications all over the planet!?!?!?! Well, you would celebrate the
    entry of the new millenium!!!!!!! That's because there's going to be an atmospheric
    storm- in the year 2000!!!!!!! So if your computer doesn't work, don't be too quick to
    blame the Y2K bug- it might just be a major disturbance in the ionosphere due to the
    sun being a little bit burpy!!!!!!!!! (Bet you never thought the safe operation of your
    computer could be dependent on your nearest stellar neighbour having good table
    manners!!!!!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.ntgov.com/gcn/gcn/1998/october19/33.htm">http://www.ntgov.com/gcn/gcn/1998/october19/33.htm</a></p>
