<p>Here's an interesting site called "<b>Night-time lights of the entire world</b>"!!!! Which is-
    what the entire world looks like at night!!!!!!!! Only thing is... the entire world isn't
    in darkness!!!!!! Only half of it is, because the other half is turned to the sun!!!!!! So it's
    also a good guide to what the Earth would look like if the sun went away!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov:8080/production/html/BIOMASS/night.html">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov:8080/production/html/BIOMASS/night.html</a></p>
