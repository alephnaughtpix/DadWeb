<p>Yes!!!!!!!! Someone's done Quake in Java!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, not really, but most of it's
    in Java, and part of the really fiddly bits are done in machine code!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.rebelboatrocker.com/main.html">http://www.rebelboatrocker.com/main.html</a></p><p>However, they're not the only Quake clone around in Java!!!!! The old Atari demo crew, the
    Carebears have done a little game called "<b>Frag Island</b>" completely in Java, with no
    machine-code bits!!!!!!! If you have a reasonably fast computer and Netscape/IE 4, then this
    is a rather neat-o little game!!!!!! Only problem is that it's a bit slow on my 486!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://fragisland.fragzone.se/">http://fragisland.fragzone.se/</a></p>
