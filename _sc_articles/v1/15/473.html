<p>Yes, that's right!!!!!! According to this website, you can buy quantities of the highly
    toxic radioactive substance, at a bargain bin price of "$5.45 per milligram"!!!! If that
    sounds a little expensive, remember that a milligram of it is enough to cause cancer!!!!
    So if you have a business competitor or someone else you want to get rid of, it doesn't
    sound that much does it?!?!?!?!?!? And remember, as this website says: <i>"Quantity
    discounts may be available. Call for current discounted price"</i>!!!!!!!!!</p><p>I wonder what would happen if a load of people call in pretendening to be "Mr Hussein"
    from "Baghdad"?!?!?!?!??!!</p><p><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/isotopes/r_pu240.htm">http://www.ornl.gov/isotopes/r_pu240.htm</a></p>
