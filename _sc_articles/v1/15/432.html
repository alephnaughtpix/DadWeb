<p>At the same time as the record companies are going mad about this MP3 acting like it
    was the new "casette tape" or something big like that, a whole load of companies who
    actually use MP3 are banding together to promote the format!!!!!!! GoodNoise, MP3.com,
    MusicMatch, and Xing Technology, and Diamond Multimedia are the dudes together and say:
    "Three cheers for MP3!!!!!!!!!" Oddly enough, one of them, Diamond Multimedia, are the
    people who made the Rio MP3 player that's got right up the collective nose of the
    American Recording industry!!!!!! (See <a href="13.html#362">issue 13</a>...)</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28168,00.html?st.cn.nws.rl.ne">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,28168,00.html?st.cn.nws.rl.ne</a></p>
