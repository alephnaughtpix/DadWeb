<p>As reported last issue, RealAudio were claiming that Microsofts media player
    nobbled their RealPlayer upon installation. Well, just after we sent out
    issue 3, we heard that MS we claiming that it was RealAudio's fault- they
    hadn't set themselves up in the registry properly!!</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/7-23realnet2.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/7-23realnet2.htm</a></p><p>But RealAudio hit back pretty quickly- seems like they're definately sure
    it's MS doing the dirty, and Real have got a few others to give some evidence
    as well!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.real.com/corporate/pressroom/pr/testimony/index.html">http://www.real.com/corporate/pressroom/pr/testimony/index.html</a></p>
