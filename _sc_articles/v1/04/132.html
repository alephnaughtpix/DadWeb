<p>It turns that all the army stuff sold by US Army Surplus dudes might
    occasionally include stuff that wasn't really meant to be sold!!!! Some
    classified military tech has sold overseas- stuff like night-vision
    goggles and bits of missiles!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/004083.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/004083.htm</a></p>
