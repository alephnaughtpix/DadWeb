<p>Remember when spiffy high-end computer systems used be promoted in terms
    of how many "mips" (millions of instructions/sec) could be done by the
    machine?!?! Well, IBM's now done a machine that can do BIPS!!!! No, I'm
    not talking about the noises from a Sinclair Speccy, or some computer
    simulation of a French mime artist!!! I'm talking billions of instructions
    per second!!! Or 1,040 MIPS to be exact!! The only thing that's faster
    is milk- because it's "pasturised" before you see it!!! (DOH!!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://cnnfn.com/digitaljam/wires/9807/28/ibm_wg/">http://cnnfn.com/digitaljam/wires/9807/28/ibm_wg/</a></p>
