<p>A couple of people at our web provider have recently had people fakemailing 
    spam using their email addresses as the return address!!!!! So we know 
    how Peter Hall might feel when he was mistakenly accused of being a 
    spammer by Earthlink!!! But this being America, he's of course brought 
    out the lawyers to say exactly how chessed off he is, and is suing Earthlink 
    for stuff like libel and so on!!!! If he wins this, it'll certainly 
    change the way ISPs deal with spammers, because this sort of stuff 
    is getting a bit more common as spammers are getting more desperate!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/14213.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/14213.html</a></p>
