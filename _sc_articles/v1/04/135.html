<p>Ever wondered what email sounds like!?!?! Well, now you can find out-
    for free!!! "Cool Mail" is yet another one of those free email
    type combos like all the others, except that you can actually read your
    email by telephone without a computer!!! It actually runs a speach
    synth on your email!!! You can also "dictate" messages back!!!! If tried
    to dictate my messages ever the phone, they would end up with very long
    spaces in them!!!! Anyway, how would I be able to dictate my sigfile!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.planetarymotion.com/">http://www.planetarymotion.com/</a></p>
