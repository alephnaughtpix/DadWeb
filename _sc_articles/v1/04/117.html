<p>This is pretty interesting!!!! VRD technology- what is this you trumpet
    like an elephant?!?! Well, it's a retinal display!!! Yep, that's right-
    the display in your EYE!!!!!!! It works by scanning "an electronically
    encoded beam of light through the pupil to the retina, stimulating the
    receptors on the back of the eye. The user has the impression
    of viewing a high quality video image an arm's length away." Woo!!!
    Guess that look like the VR headsets will go out of date now!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.mvis.com/html/technology.html">http://www.mvis.com/html/technology.html</a></p>
