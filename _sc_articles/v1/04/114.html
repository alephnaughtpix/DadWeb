<p>Well, you might have seen a previous issue and seen the first major label release of an 
    MP3 "single", (See <a href="2.html#"> issue 2</a>...) but wondered why 
    they chose to launch it with a bunch of non-entities from San Franciso, 
    well things have changed a bit this week!!!! Goodnoise, some internet 
    music company thingy has started selling downloadable music, and the 
    artist they've started with is Frank Black!!!!!! Yes!!!! The character 
    from the cult series "Millenium"!!!!! You can get a couple of sample 
    tracks from his album, and then buy the full thing later!!!! I wonder 
    if he says "Solyent Green Is People" in this one?!??!?!</p><p><a href="http://www.goodnoise.com/artist/frank_black/fbdl.html">http://www.goodnoise.com/artist/frank_black/fbdl.html</a></p>
