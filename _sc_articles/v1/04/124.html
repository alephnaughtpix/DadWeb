<p>I've read something on Digitiser News (p171 UK C4 teletext) about
    a "CIH virus"!!! The funny thing about this is that if you're into
    the Atari demo scene like us, you'll know that there's already a well-known
    "CIH" in the form of Chris Holland the editor of the well-known Atari
    diskmag "Maggie"!!! Anyway, it turns out that this is the BIOS-killing
    virus we were going on about last issue!!!! Boy these media types are
    really fast!!!</p><p><a href="http://x4.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=374763588&amp;CONTEXT=902268425.1045692449&amp;hitnum=106">http://x4.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=374763588<br/>
