<p>There's a really interesting site called "Acronym Finder", which allows
    you to type in words, and find out if they're acronyms for anything!!!
    I've tried "Senior" and "Dads" into it can got:
  <ul>
<li><b>Senior</b> = "Nickname for HQ USAF Programs Usually Connected With Logistics Support"!!!!</li>
<li><b>Dads</b> = "Data Archive &amp; Distribution System"!!!!</li>
</ul>
