Evening Times Thu 6 Aug 1998 front page.

The world's richest man has threatened to
pull the plug on hundreds of Scottish jobs.

Microsoft boss Bill Gates is furious over
raids on an East Kibride company that have
cost his computer firm millions of pounds.
    The American giants have slapped a
Â£500,000 "fine" on printing firm
Thomson Litho after the theft of 115,000
authenticity certificates for Microsoft
products.
    Thomson executives were so worried that
deputy chairman Gary Thomson flew to America
to plead with Microsoft - their biggest
client - not to withdraw their contract.
    But Gates said: "This is no bluff, we're
ready to pull the plug and Scotland will
suffer."
    Thomson plants in East Kilbride employ
more than 500 people. They have now been
hit twice by thieves.
    The first raid, last November, saw three
armed men burst into the factory - tie up
guards - and escape with a van full of CDs.
    The most recent raid saw authenticity
certificates stolen. These can turn pirate
copies into legitimate-looking products.

    RAIDS

Company hosses and police believe the raids
are the work of insiders.
  Gary Thomson said today: "The only people
I can trust in here are those who were on
holiday at the time of the last raid.
  "We want the stolen certificates back,
and to find the internal mole." Gary, who
jetted off to Washington to plead his firm's
case at a Microsoft board meeting, added: "We
were that close to losing our biggest client.
As a printing business we never realised just
how vulnerable we were to these hi-tech
criminals.
  "We convinced Microsoft that, as a firm,
we've wakened up to the threat facing us.

    BATTLE

"We have taken measures to ensure our security
matches that expected of us by the world's
leading computer software firm."
    The threat to Thomson's workers is just
the tip of the iceberg. More than 75,000 jobs
are involved in Scotland's Silicon Valley.
    Microsoft, whose Windows software is used
in 80 per cent of the world's desktops, has
admitted it's fighting a losing battle against
a computer mafia.
    The firm reckons it will lose Â£250m
through software pirates - a large proportion
of which will come from Scotland.
    And the crisis could jeopardise Scotland's
standing as a leading software centre - and
hinder hopes of further of inward investment.</pre>
