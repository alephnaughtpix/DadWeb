<p>Yep!!! Another flippin' search engine for tha mighty megabig superinfo
    highway supadupey webby!!! The difference is that this designed by
    the Memory Man company who is headed by some dude who's apparently
    very good with his memory!!!!! (I've forgotten his name tho) And it's
    supposed to be organised in the way the human memory memory works, and
    is therefore really user-friendly and stuff. It's also a really spiffily
    good ad for this company, which I've never heard of before I saw this
    press release!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980805/memoryman_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/980805/memoryman_1.html</a></p>
