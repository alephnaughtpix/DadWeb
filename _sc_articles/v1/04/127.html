<p>Have you got a computer permanently connected to the Internet!?!?! Well, 
    then you might just the sort of person to help look for alien lifeforms!!!! 
    SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) is getting loads 
    of Internet-connected computes together in a big distributed computing 
    project called "SETI@home"!!! It's a bit like those distributed computing 
    networks that were cracking encryption codes, expect, it's with signals 
    from the stars, and they're looking for evidence of ET!!! Perhaps, we'll 
    phone him at home while we're at it!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/</a></p>
