<p>Have you heard of those spiffy new soaps with "triclosan" in it!?!? It
    gets rid of all the usual bacteria- but wait!!!! You might instead get
    *unusual* bacteria instead!!!! The triclosan may actually result in
    mutated bacteria that is not very nice at all!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9808/05/antibacterial.warning/">http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9808/05/antibacterial.warning/</a></p>
