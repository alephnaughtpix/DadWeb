<p>What with all those 12903 bit encryptions getting cracked in record time by loads of people, 
    you'd think all this encryption business was pretty insecure!!! And 
    you'd be right!!!! But one software company has decided to rip off 
    all the old spy techniques of coding their messages using "manual hardware" 
    means- in this case, the old "one-time-pad" stuff, where everytime 
    the message is envcrypted differently according to a page in a "pad", 
    which is only used once, then destroyed!!! Only problem is... How do 
    you do that in a software form and make *that* secure?!?! You'd have 
    to transmit the "pad" to someone so that they can receive your messages, 
    so if someone intercepts that, then bang goes your security!!! The 
    software dudes are currently using normal key encryption to transmit 
    the "pads", so that can be broken!!!! To be really secure, you'd probably 
    have to keep the last "page" of the current "pad" in order to encrypt 
    the transmission of the next pad!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/13920.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/13920.html</a></p>
