<p>I saw this "interesting" little story on the message board of Squid's
    Amiga pages... A couple of friends at a scottish Uni had a regular "fight
    by email" going!!! A bit like those role-playing by email type games, except
    it's one person doing a "fight" move against the other eg "I kick you", then
    "I've dodged your kick and hit you back" and so on!!! Then they both landed
    an inbetween-terms work placement at the same company!!!! So they carried on
    the "fight" at the company...
  <p>Unfortunately, when one of them sent his
    latest message, apparently for some reason (Either the email addr was
    typed incorrectly or the prog tried "guessing" halfway through typing!!!)
    MS Outlook Express, the proggy used, tried to guess who was being sent to,
    and came up with the email addr of this guy's boss!!!! So now, he's
    looking for a new placement...
