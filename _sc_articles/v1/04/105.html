<p>I saw this <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a>, but this
    is too intresting to miss out!! Some dude's done a program for Linux systems
    to record whatever's being output by the soundcard, so obviously even stuff
    that can't be saved or copied can still be read and saved!!! Of course, as
    the author says, that would be very naughty, so don't do it!!!</p><p><a href="http://source.syr.edu/~jdimpson/proj/#paudio">http://source.syr.edu/~jdimpson/proj/#paudio</a></p>
