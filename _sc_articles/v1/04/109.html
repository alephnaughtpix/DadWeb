<p>Well, you can't keep a good US survivalist down!!! After zillions of other
    possible apocalypse scenarios have fallen by the wayside in a non-apocalyptic
    manner, they find another one as an excuse for their wacky behaviour!! And
    the latest one is actually quite a reasonable bet for them- no society breaking
    down or Wormwood hitting the Earth type nonsense, it's our old friend, the
    Millenium Bug!!! They're fearing all the computers and stuff stopping and
    society breaking down and all the other survivalist cliches!!! "I look at
    it as Judgment Day," one of the dudes rather predictably says... (How come
    you never hear of survivalists who are Buddhists or into some other religion?!?!
    I mean a survivalist that talked like Yoda- now that would be cool!!!!)</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/27/millennium.survivalists.reut/">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/27/millennium.survivalists.reut/</a></p><p>Meanwhile one bunch that look as though they won't be too badly are the insurance
    companies!!!! In the US, they've been busy getting permission to exclude
    claims resulting from the Millenium bug!!!!</p><p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/apf/980805/year_2000__1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/apf/980805/year_2000__1.html</a></p><p>But's not stopped the lawyers in the US!! Already there's been some lawsuits
    filed even before 2000!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,24954,00.html">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,24954,00.html</a></p>
