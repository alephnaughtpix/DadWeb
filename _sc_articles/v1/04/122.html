<p>My goodness!!! I wondered if I was looking at the right site when I logged
    onto "Ain't it Cool News" after I came back from my holiday!!! Gone is
    the madman style design, and now it looks a bit like a wierd kind of
    movie reviews site, loads of indexes and stuff!!! They've also integrated
    the chat section with the various news sections, a bit like Slashdot! Tho-
    one thing you'll notice- the actual content is just the same!!!! Just as
    well I say!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/</a></p>
