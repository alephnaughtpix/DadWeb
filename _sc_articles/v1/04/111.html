<p>Well, a week after 
    they were supposed to have originally released it (See <a href="3.html#59"> 
    issue 3</a>...) , the first issue of the Scottish "Private Eye" style 
    ezine is out!!!! It's in email form, as the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> 
    website isn't up yet ATM, and the Gamerush address (See below) just 
    gives a pointer to a subscribe address to the email-delivered zine (Well, 
    at least it was- the actual pages appear to have disappeared Thurs 8 
    Aug!!!)</p><p>Anyway, the "Late transmition to allow the competition to exhaust themselves !"
    excuse for it being one week late was apparently in reference to a
    concerted attack on by some hackers!!!! Maybe the hackers read the
    Sunday times interview!!!</p><p>Anyway, despite the claim on the Gamerush page that "Contrary to the press we
    have received, this publication is supposed to be an entertaining look at
    Scotland, not scandalous", Scotland the Raw starts off very much like a
    Private Eye style mag!!! One of the people involved is apparently a paid-up
    member of the Labour party, and the editor is quoted in the Sunday Times
    interview as not really supporting independence for Scotland, so maybe this
    explains why the scandal stuff appears to be mostly about Labours main
    rivals in Scotland, the independence-supporting SNP!!!! Mind you, the
    "top" story about selection of SNP candidates isn't quite as juicy as
    the Eye stories about selection in the Labour camp- in fact, the whole
    thing appears incredibly waffly!!! Hardly the "designed to be easily
    digested titbits of salacious rumour which can be read on a coffee break"
    business we were promised in the Sunday Times interview!!! OK, I'm used
    to extremely compact ezines like Need to Know (<a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a> ),
    but I thought e-zine items were supposed to be short!!! (eg this is
    the longest article I've ever written for Senior Citizen!!!)</p><p>Even, wierder, just when it seems to be chugging along like one of those funny 
    mags you used to get at Poll Tax demonstrations, then... "Gaming"!!!! 
    Huh!?!? Private Eye didn't have a computer games section!!!! What 
    we get is a report from the E3!!!! (Yep, a bit late, isn't it!!! (See 
    <a href="0.html#"> issue 0</a>...) ) It's subtitled "Cutting Through 
    the Hype!", but you have to wonder about that, since the whole gaming 
    section is actually "provided by <a href="http://www.gamerush.com">http://www.gamerush.com</a> 
    part of Reality X Interactive"!!! Who?!?!? Yes, it's from the same 
    company who do Scotland the Raw!!! No hype there I guess!!!!!</p><p>Anyway, it was just as boring as you
    might imagine: so and so was on display at this stall yawn ZzzzZzzz...
    Why do all reports from games exhibitions sound incredibly boring?!?!
    Slightly more interesting was the mention of Scottish gaming firms,
    which you don't usually hear of in the gaming press. Given that this is
    supposed to be some sort of "Scottish" maggy, it would be pretty
    interesting to hear a bit more about Scottish games firms!!!!!</p><p>After that, another bizzare switch- this time to "Social Scotland", with
    what is apparently a "review" of T in the Park (A bit more up-to-date
    than the E3!!!!)!!!! I say "apparently", because the first 3 of the 6
    paras are taken up with a rant about events in the hospitality tent,
    which develops into what appears to be yet another slag off of the
    SNP!!!! The next para says something about some "gig ban", and then
    the last 2 (very short) paras are about the actual bloody concerts!!!!
    I think it says a lot that the "reviewer" apparently really liked
    Robbie Williams, Prodigy, The Seahorses, Catatonia, Super Furry Animals,
    and Spiritualized- but couldn't say very much about it!!!!</p><p>In general, I think Scotland the Raw is pretty interesting for a first
    issue!!! I think they could perhaps be a bit more even in style, instead
    of jumping from Private Eye to The Edge to The List in quick
    succession!!! (And get rid of those Gamesrush castoffs!! it's pretty
    obvious!!!) The writing is pretty good, but could be a bit less waffly (Go read Wired News
    or Need to Know!!!), the reviews could actually *review* the bloody things,
    and there are pretty obvious political biases- either be bit more
    even-handed, or just be honest about them!!! In general, I think they
    have good potential, and with a bit of work, could be quite decent!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm">http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm</a></p><p>If that doesn't work, why not try emailing them direct and asking for a
    subscription to the zine? And tell them to fix the web page while they're
    at it!!!!</p><p><a href="mailto://str@gamerush.com">mailto://str@gamerush.com</a></p>
