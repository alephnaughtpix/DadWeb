<p>Sounds wierd, but it's "micro-electro mechanical systems" time again!!
    We're not just talking about little machines that you can hold in your
    hand, but machines so tiny that they be held in suspension in a liquid,
    like paint!!! So you can "paint" a speaker or TV screen!!! The LA Times
    reports says somthing about some boy and his "purple crayon", which
    sounds a bit rude!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/CUTTING/lat_smart0727.htm">http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/CUTTING/lat_smart0727.htm</a></p>
