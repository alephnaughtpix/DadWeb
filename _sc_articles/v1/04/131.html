<p>Remember the video for Jimmy Nail's "Ain't No Doubt"
    where Jimmy's in the phone box and he says
    "She's Lying!!!"?!?!? Well, he might have been using this
    device by Seem software called "Truster"- an
    over-the-phone lie detector!!!! It detects funny
    things called "microtremors" in a voice!!!! (Wonder
    what would happen on a bad line!!!!) Only prob is
    that Jimmy would have to plug the phone booth into
    his computer and run "Truster" on it!!!! And I don't
    see no computer in the video!!!!! So how does Jimmy
    know she's lying then!?!??!?!?!</p><p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9808/04/liedetect.idg/index.html">http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9808/04/liedetect.idg/index.html</a></p><p>For some reason, some of the people on Slashdot are
