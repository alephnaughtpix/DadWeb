<p>Well, even if the Y2K problem doesn't end all civilisation as we know it and so on, 
    then there might be problem from people who think it'll end all civilisation 
    as we know it!!! As mentioned before, some of loony US survivalist types 
    are thinking that the Y2K is definately the absolute certain, absolutely 
    no doubt about it. this time definately it's it, that "meteorite" scenario 
    was really wasn't it, no this is really it, end of the world!!!!! (See 
    <a href="4.html#109"> issue 4</a>...) Well, it looks like some of the 
    more militant types who actually use their weapons might get wound up 
    enough by this millenium bug to shoot and blow up things!!!! I bet the 
    programmers who programmed old mainframe systems with 2 digit years 
    in the dates didn't quite see this coming!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.charlotte.com/0907terror.htm">http://www.charlotte.com/0907terror.htm</a></p>
