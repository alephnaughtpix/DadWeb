<p>If wanted you advertise a spiffy new dance-music creation proggy at the
    world's biggest computer fair Comdex, how
    would you publicise it?!?!?!? Would you for example get a whole load of people
    together with placards complaining about it, and tell people under no
    circumstances go to exhibit no. XX where you're selling the proggy?!?!?!? Well,
    erm, that's exactly what this lot have done!!!!!!</p><p>It's a bit silly if you ask me!!!!!! Mind you, they named this program "Acid",
      so what do you expect!!!!!!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16284.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/16284.html</a></p>
