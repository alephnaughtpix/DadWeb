<p>Honestly, some scientests!!!!!!!! This little story is about some scientest
    testing how some chemical works... So what you might say!!!! Well, apparently
    they're interested in this particular chemical because if you put it on your
    tongue, it feels like an electric charge!!!!!!!! Wait a sec- how would they
    know that?!?!?!?! Have they been sticking their tongue into electric sockets
    or something?!??!?!?!?</p><p><a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981117/newscien/911260860-3154853946.html">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/19981117/newscien/<br/>
