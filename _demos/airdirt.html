  <p>The version released was the second version of the demo. The first was scrapped when persons who shall remain
    nameless (IPIR!!!) decided to release an early version of it as their "own" demo at the NASA96 show! (That's the
    last time we'll show you our source-code guys!) However it made us more determined to get a killer demo out, and we
    did!</p>
