    <p>This was out first ever Faclon 070 demo but what a demo!!! The <strong><em>first ever one-scanline full frame
                trucolour fire</em></strong> on C-lab's bird of pray!</p>
    <p>Even more amazing it was done in <strong>less than half an hour</strong>!!! Why? Because that's all the time we
        had before the deadline for the demo competition! This demo was done for the <strong>Fried Bits 3</strong> 96K
        demo compo. We suddenly decided in the last half an hour before the deadline that the 96K demo competition would
        present a good enough challenge for us. (We would have entered the best demo compo, but it was too easy- you
        don't know how lucky you were to win it, <strong><a
                href="../../computers/crews/atari.html#Lazer">Lazer</a></strong>!)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our demo was shown right after <strong><a href="../../computers/crews/atari.html#Inter">Inter</a></strong>'s
        mega-long 96K-tro "<strong><a href="../../computers/demos/falcon_030.html#TerroriseYourSoul">Terrorise Your
                Soul</a></strong>", which just pipped us to the post to win the competition. Their demo wasn't too bad,
        but our demo with it's simplicity and brevity (Hey I can use big words!!!) really blow it away!</p>
    <h2>Credits:</h2>
    <p>This is a wierd one, because it went out our old names before we decide to revamp our image and launch our
        website! <strong>Old Fart</strong> used to be called "Nonce" and <strong>Doddering Git</strong> used to be
        called "Jesse". This (and the title of the demo) was actually meant to be an ironic political statement about
        sexual and gender role models within a corrupt Western society, but unfortunately a lot of people got the wrong
        end of the stick, so we decided to ditch the old names for the next demo.</p>
    <p>More importantly, <strong>Dame Vera Lynn</strong> wasn't credited! He wasn't too pleased with that to say the
        least. <span class="highlight">[You can say that again- Dame VL]</span> Oh OK then... He wasn't too pleased with
        that to say the least. Ha ha ha ha ha!!! <span class="highlight">[Top joke! Classic, man! -Dame VL]</span></p>
