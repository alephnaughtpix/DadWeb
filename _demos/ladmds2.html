      title="pHas3 40uR sT3r30!!11!" width="70">This is an unusual demo in that it was originally done by French demo
    crew <strong>Atrocity</strong> for the Falcon. We managed to get it working on the JTS STE!! It's also unusual in
    that there's <a href="#versions">two versions</a> of the demo going about!!!</p>

  <h2>Atrocity's bit!</h2>
  <p>Released 1st March 1995.</p>

    soundtracker routines by <strong>Wizzcat</strong>.</p>

  <p>Oh yeah, those mug-shots in the intro were done by us at the <strong>Megafun 5</strong> party at Lille. Everyone in
    Atrocity is in featured here. Hope no-one from college sees us, because that wouldn't be funny!</p>

  <h2>SENI0R DADS BIT!<p></p>
  </h2>
  <p>We found this cool French demo on a French FTP server, and decided to spread it arounda bit. We've packed it so it
    can fit on a DD disk, and added our own little intro to it.</p>

<p>You can run this demo from a hard drive by simply copying all the files across. Run "LOADER.PRG" to start the demo.
  If you've already got all the files on the hard drive and you want to run them from a disk, you copy ALL the files
  (Yes, including the DESKTOP.INF and NEWDESK.INF files onto a disk. Make sure you virus protect it, then just boot up
  the disk.</p>

<h3><a name ="versions">Why are there <span class="blink">TWO</span> versions of the demo?</a>
  <p>Yes, that's right- there are 2 different versions of "L' Aube Du Matin Du Soir 2", a <strong>European</strong>
    version and a <strong>UK</strong> version. The European version is the original version we did and uploaded to
    European FTP servers, and is the version which you can download from this page. The UK version was done when we
    wanted to upload the demo to a couple of UK Atari bulletin boards. We had to clean up a couple things for the UK
    audience! Here are the differences between the two versions...</p>

<h3>The <span class="blink">hidden </span>screen!</h3>
<p>Yes, there's also a hidden screen in both versions of the demo. There's <strong>one</strong> false ending when
  Atrocity's parts of the demo ends saying "fin", then our endpart suddenly begins, but after <strong>that</strong> is
  finished, the demo exits to the desktop, <em>but it's still not finished!!!!</em> There's another hidden part! See if
  you can find it!</p>
