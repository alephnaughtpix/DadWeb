    <h4>The Story behind this demo:</h4>
    <p>If you're thinking this a stunning new demo to blast your JTS into another dimension, you're so wrong! In fact,
      this is a stunning <strong>old</strong> demo to blast your JTS into another dimension!!! This is in fact the
      <strong>first </strong>ever demo that we (Old Fart and Doddering Git) ever did, back in the days before we had a
      Faclon 070, ST Floormat was still around, and were still called Nonce and Jessie (A lot of people still don't
      understand the important ironic political point we were trying to make!). The reason you're seeing it now is
      because of certain "legal" problems.</p>
    <p><a href="pc.html"><img align="right" alt="pAc1F1sT c0MpAt1Bl3!!1!" height="60" src="{{ "/assets/images/demos/pacifist.gif" | relative_url }}"
          title="pAc1F1sT c0MpAt1Bl3!!1!" width="147"></a>Fast Forward back to <strong>ST Floormat</strong>'s Oxember
      1884 issue, which featured a demo feature on demos, called<strong><em> "Demos- are they a load of crap or
          what?"</em></strong>. A few months before they were asking for demo coders to contact them. Well, how could we
      refuse? So we contacted them, and agreed to do a demo for their cover disk, and signed a funny piece of paper with
      lots of big words to that effect.</p>
    <p>Well, imagine our shock and horror when we saw the issue of ST Floormat and saw <strong>OUR DEMO GOING OUT UNDER
        OTHER PEOPLE'S NAMES!!!</strong> The bastards changed the gfx, muzix and skrollees, and said in their magazine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p style="font-face:Helvetica;">"We got our assembler experts to show they could beat those sad anorack demo
        coders at their own game- run this, and see how it <strong>should </strong>be done!"</p>
    </ul>
    <p>We phoned up the tossers, and told them to go forth and multiply! They then pointed out that with with the bit of
      paper we signed, the opposite applied! It's only now that <strong>ST Floormat</strong> is dead (Good riddance!)
      that we can release this demo. And also their laywers are off our backs, so we don't have to be nice to them any
      more either!</p>
