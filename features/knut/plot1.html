<p>   
    Ok, here's the initial plot line for episode
    1!!! We might have to change some bits, so that it doesn't look to much
    like a certain "other" series, but we like what we've done so far!!!</p><p>
    BTW we attempted to translate this plotline into German, then <a target="_blank" href="plot1_ege.txt">translated it
    back into English</a> to see how well we did. We're quite pleased!!!!! It obviously has international appeel!!!</p>

    <header>(Initial!) Plot line of <b>Episode One</b></header>
    <div>
        <p>Four
            really cool demo-coding students at <b>Milton
            Central</b> Uni (!!!) are downloading some
            disgusting pictures of full-motion GIF videos of <b>Star
            Trek</b> porn (Using 3D mapped pictures of
            the actors from digitistised from videos of the TV series, so they look
            like a Terry Gilliam animation out of <b>Monty
            Python</b>!!!) from <b>alt.bin.edu.milton.central.uni.students.sociology.sex.star.trek.full.motion.gif.videos.of.star.trek.porn</b>
            on the Internet, then they get into some porno chat room with some fat
            bint called "<b>Horny Henrietta</b>"
            (Which looks like a New York cable access channel, where all those fat
            bints go around singing "I Will Survive" or some other old 60s song), and
            they hear an "internet phone call" from some sexy sounding female calling
            herself "<b>Susie Shagalot</b>",
            who happens to live, amazingly enough, out of the entire Internet to choose
            from, just down the road from them!!</p>
        <p>So they
            go down to her "pad" (Which looks really expensive, even though she's really
            a cheap prostitute!!!) and get <b>shagged
            senseless</b> by her (Thus taking care of
            the gratuitous sex quoitent in all these "adult" dramas.) and take <b>loads
            of drugs</b> (Especially "F", so we can get
            a good blast of jungle music, and get the young people interested!!) and
            they all fall asleep because they're "stoned" and "shagged out" <i>(That
            joke is (c) us BTW!!!!)</i>. Then Susie pinches their wallets to get their
            credit cards, and uses the Internet through her "<b>connected
            CD-ROM</b>" to get loadsamoney from their
            bank accounts! When one of the guys wakes and sees her doing it, she disappears,
            just like one of the <b>Tomorrow People</b>!!</p>
        <p>The next
            day, our young heroes <b>flame</b>
            her on all the newsgroups, saying such soul-destroying things as <i>"she
            has small tits!!!!"</i> And then they search the entire Internet looking
            for references to people disappearing just like the Tomorrow People. They
            find that the construction details of a device to do such a thing was recently
            published in an online electronic h/p/v/a/c "<b>hackers</b>"
            type "zine" from the US called "<b>PHAK-U</b>!",
            so they read that. By a bizarre coincidence, the news section in the mag
            (Which is read using a special MP3 speach synthesiser, and sounds like
            Bill &amp; Ted out of "<b>Waynes World</b>"!!!)
            talks of a "reel kewel radical <b>game</b>
            for all you kewel nerds thats reely kewel- dude!" or something, called
            "<b>Mindless Chemical Warfare</b>",
            and our guys think that might be a cool thing to send away $200 for! So,
            they get it, and after installing an 4DFX soundcard into the reverse polarity
            microwave link of their Pentium fan, they run it. Cue slightly jerky video
            footage of John Inman from "<b>Are You Being
            Served</b>", with voice overdubbed by James
            Earl Jones: "<b>Welcome to 'MINDLESS CHEMICAL
            WARFARE'. UK. Please choose from the following cities: London. Manchester.
            Birmingham. Edinburgh. Milton</b>" ...</p>
