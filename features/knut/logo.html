    Believe
    it or not, people have been asking us how we did our nice cool <b>Killer
    Nut</b> logo. They have even been asking if... it's been ripped off from
    a certain <blink>other</blink> programme.</p>
    
    <p>Well, of course it isn't. I'm
    a totally original artist and I do all my own work! Of course I did the
    "Killer Nut" logo! In fact, it was a really easy logo to do, in fact so
    easy that I can now tell you how I did it!
    
    </p><p>Prepare to be astounded by
    the ultimate sense of easiness and ordinaryness of the seven little magic
    steps, using your average common or garden <b>Photoshop</b> (Version 3
    or later...), or any image manipulation prog that can do <b>RGB colours, layers, text, fill, and blur</b>.
    (<b><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a></b> for example.)</p>

        <h3>Step one:</h3>
        <h4>Make a nice background!</h4>
        <p>It's dead
            easy, just fill in the background with any colour you like- Red, blue,
            cyan, puce, or any other Teletubbies colours!! Except <b>GREEN,
            or BLACK!!!</b></p>

    <div>
        <h3>Step two:</h3>
        <h4>Do the text in green!</h4>
        <p>This is really easy too! Just
            make a new layer with the text "Killer Nut" in bright green (0,255,0) in
            the font <b>Impact</b> in 48pt, and stick in the centre of the image.</p>
    </div>

        <img src="{{ "/assets/images/features/knut/logo/step3.gif" | relative_url }}" />
    </header>
    <div>
        <h3>Step three:</h3>
        <h4>Do a copy of the text in black!</h4>
        <p>Now you can see why I told you
            not to fill the background in green or black, can't you? Anyway, this is
            also very easy-peasy! Just duplicate the layer with the text in it, and
            colour it black.</p>

    </header>
    <div>
        <h3>Step four:</h3>
        <h4>Blur the green text!</h4>
        <p>Go to the layer with the green
            verion of the text, and do a <b>Gaussian Blur</b> at level of <b>5.0</b>
            ... Easy huh?</p>

    </header>
    <div>
        <h3>Step five:</h3>
        <h4>Blur a copy of the blur!</h4>
        <p>Now duplicate that blurred layer,
            and blur the copy in exactly the same way. I know what you're thinking,
            this art business is too easy. Wait until you see the next bit!</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Step six:</h3>
        <h4>Add it all together!</h4>
        <p>Make all the layers visible, and
            make sure the black text is on the top- hey presto, instant "Killer Nut"
            logo on a red background!!! Now all that remains is...</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Step seven:</h3>
        <h4>Change the background to black!</h4>
        <p>Yes, just fill the layer with
            the background colour with black! And there you are- a lovely "Killer Nut"
            logo of your very own! Wow, isn't this art business easy? Well it is if
            you've got a genius like me guiding you!</p>
