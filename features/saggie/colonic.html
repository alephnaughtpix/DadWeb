    <h2>Maggie Reviews Senior Dads "Colonic Irrigation" demo!</h2>
</center>
You can tell this review is pretty old as we're still called Nonce
and Jessie sometimes!! In fact we got mentioned in the news in the same
issue:

    <b>[] SENIOR DADS RETURN</b>
    <p>

        Heroes of the Fried Bits III 96ktro competition, "The Senior Dads", who have
        already built up a cult following after their revolutionary "Anal Tuck" demo are
        working on a new Falcon demo. Main coder, "Nonce", commented "its like some
        pictures, but different". We can't wait.

        <b>[] SENIOR DADS HIT THE NET</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The very foundations of the information superhighway were left shaking yesterday
        as the Senior Dads announced they would be setting up their own World Wide Web
        site. Described by dsp coder, doddering git, as "senior - in the extreme" it
        draws net surfers into a senior world. All dads demos to date can be download
        from this site, including the new 69ktro.

    Reporters!! Ha, can't trust them can you?!?!? We don't remember making those
    quotes to Maggie!! Anyway, they still were good to us with their review...

    <h2>COLONIC IRRIGATION</h2>
    <h3>BY THE SENIOR DADS</h3>
</center>
<p>
    Perhaps if there was one jaw-dropping, technically stunning, aurally
    astounding, genre-defining demo released in 1995 it was "Anal Tuck" by
    The Senior Dads. It was a demo that took the Fried Bits III convention
    by storm, tossing away all the traditional conventions of demo coding
    and replacing them with line a calls. It was breathtaking - the Dads
    had changed the face of demo coding with a single call to the Gemdos
    print line routine.
</p>
<p>
    The work of Nonce and Jessie will go down in the anals of history.
    There were those who said it couldn't be bettered, that sequels would
    be pointless - how can you improve on perfection? But once again the
    Senior Dads have confounded the critics by releasing a demo of such
    quality, such ambition that people have been driven to worship it.
</p>
<p>
    Over the last couple of years demo effects have become more realistic.
    Natural phenomena like fire and smoke have been emulated.
    Flatshaded polygons have been replaced with better lighting models
    such as Gouraud &amp; Phong shading. Texture Mapping has created
    life like environments. But one elements of nature has remained
    relatively anonymous - water.
</p>
<p>
    The Senior Dads are experts at passing water and quickly realised its
    potential. But they also had the temerity to take a non standard water
    situation - that of irrigation - and give it the true colour
    treatment.
</p>
<p>
    You can almost hear the DSP straining under the weight of the parallel
    instructions as it creates the irrigation model. Look at the screen
    and you will not believe the sight in front of your eyes. They also
    manage to scroll messages up the screen (using the 68030 in parallel)
    and decided to use GEMDOS calls for the scroller so the demo would run
    on the forthcoming Microbox.
</p>
<p>
    The music is recorded with a new technique "phase 4 stereo" and really
    sounds like it is coming straight out of the speakers! Outstanding.
</p>
<p>
    The demo ends with the standard end scroller that has become somewhat
    of a cliche, but the Dads push this into a new dimension by adding
    insights into their world and messages to friends and enemies. The
    senior dads don't seem to rate EKO's 3D world system very highly as
    they have created their own 3D world system using line A calls which
    will be compatible with all past and future ataris. Smart move.
</p>
<p>
    The other amazing fact about this demo is that they managed to fit it
    into 69K (another ironic art statement). Their coding is compact as it
    is creative.
</p>
<p>
    So another winner from the Dads, and they promise us more. How can we
    refuse to submit to their bid for world domination?
