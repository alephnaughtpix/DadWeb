                    <p><b>Maggie</b> is a long running diskmag on the Atari scene. We like
                        Maggie. They might make up up quotes from us and make zillions of mistakes,
                        but we like them because they give us nice reviews!!! And they're a nice
                        magazine anyway with a good history in the Atari scene. </p>
