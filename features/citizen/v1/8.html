  <h2>Moggy on tha webby!!!</h2>
  <p>You might have heard about that big drum shaped thingy that you push people
    into in hospitals and it scans them!!! Well, it's called a "cat-scan"!!!!
    So when we heard there was a "cat scan" competition, we thought it might
    have been the best looking scans of peoples internal organs!!! But we were
    wrong!!! It's actually pictures made by people who pushed their pet cats
    onto scanners and scanned them!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>OK, OK, we saw this in <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a>,
    but it's too good to miss!!! There are people around who are messing around
    with Nintendo Gameboys, and have come up with a <b>Gameboy Technology</b>
    page with stuff like Gameboy to PC interfaces, and uses for the new Camera
    and Printer add-ons!!!! Pretty neat-o yummy technology as they might say

  <h2>If it all goes wrong it in Fiji, you have 12 hours left...</h2>
  <p>Well, no doubt you'll be aware that there's a lot of people saying that
    many people have already left it too late to defend themselves against the
    Millenium Bug, but if you want to *<i>really</i>* leave it to the last moment,
    here's an idea... Wait till just before midday on 31st December 1999, and
    get a satellite link to Fiji!!! Because it's just off the International
    Date Line, it's 12 hours ahead of GMT time, so the Y2K probs will hit there
    first!!! People in Fiji are making some money from this by advertising itself
    as the advance warning station for the rest of the world!!!! Only prob- what
    if the communications equipment there is not Y2K compatible!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Oldie ST demo to appear on PC!!!</h2>
  <p>If you're an computeing old-timer like us, you may remember these funny
    programs on 16-bit machines called <b>demos</b>!!! They're not the half-finished
    games you get on magazine coverdisks as you might think!!!! They're actually
    really spiffy little audio-visual experiences done for fun, like the ones
    we do!!!! One of the first demos I saw was this amazingly spangly little
    production on my little ST in 1989 called "<b>The Union Demo</b>" with loads
    of whizzy effects!!!! Well, in 1998, someone called <b>Demografica</b> has
    decided to convert it to the PC!!!! At the moment
    all that's been done is conversion of some of the chip music and graphics,
    but surely it can't be that hard to convert all the "rasters",
    "fullscreens", and "bitmap scrollers" to the PC and all it's supey-dupey
    graphics and sound capabilities!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~redrob/Union/">http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~redrob/Union/</a></p>
  <p>You can already run the original Atari version (mostly) on the PC thanks to
    Pacifist ST emulator... Well, I say "original"- it's actually a version of
    the demo cracked by the infamous ST demo-rippers <b>Ripped Off</b>, and put
    on a compilation menu by <b>Persistance of Vision</b> some time in the early
    1990s!!! The really wierd thing is that you can't get an *<i>original</i>*
    copy of the Union demo over the Internet because the original version was in
    a wierd custom disk format that could not be copied by any disk copier on the
    ST!!!! It could only be copied by an inbuilt copier program included with
    the actual demo!!!! This means it couldn't be spread by any other means,
    including bulletin boards and FTP!!!!!! Really thinking ahead, weren't
    they?!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Byte folded- but still going!!!</h2>
  <p>Ever had one of those days when nothing ever went right?!?!?! Well, it probably
    went better than the dudes at the distinguished computing magazine
    <b>Byte</b>!!!! Their proprietors just turned up and said said: Byte's
    closed, and you're all sacked- you've got one day to clear your desk,
    goodbye!!!! Well, there was probably more to it than that, but it sounds
    just like what happened to me after I produced that documentary
    "The Wonderful Story of Thrash Metal" for Radio 2!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, Byte dude and famous science-fiction writer <b>Jerry Pournelle</b>
    (You know, the person who writes stuff with David Niven's son, <b>Larry
      Niven</b>!!!!) has his own site, and on it he's reporting on the various
      ways the writers from Byte are continuing their projects on the amazing
      world wide webby!!!!</p>

  <h2>Linux Babylon!!!!</h2>
  <p>First there was <b>Hollywood Babylon</b>, a book by <b>Kenneth Anger</b> on
    Hollywood scandals!!! Then there was <b>Rock 'n' Rock Babylon</b>, a book by
    Kenneth Anger on rock 'n' rock scandals!!!! Now there's <b>Linux Babylon</b>,
    which, erm, rather disappointingly is not a book by Kenneth Anger on scandal
    in the Slashdot crowd, but a new linux-based game platform thingy which is
    supposed to be geared towards making games programming easy and so on...
    Apparently you just boot this "Babylon" system up, and then run the game on
    top of it!!! It uses all the usual Linux library type stuff like Glide,
    SVGAlib, MEDlib, etc., ... It's in an early stage, but it's an interesting
    idea!!</p>
  <p>We can't really see any established games companies actually taking it
    up to be honest, but it might be really popular with the free-software
    types, and indeed "bedroom" programmers who are getting increasingly shut out
    of the games business by proprietary standards!!!!! (Ooooh!!! Aren't we being
    political this week!!!!) The people behind this hope to port to it other
    UNIX "flavours", which would make porting games to other hardware platforms
    pretty easy!!!</p>

  <h2>The Internet makes you depressed!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is surprising!!!! Apparently someone's done a big and expensive
    study in the US and found out that people spend all their time in front of
    the computer are more likely to be lonely!!!!!! And because of that they're
    less likely to be happy!!!! So in summary- heavy internet users are sad
    lonely geeks!!! Apparently the people who put 1.5 million dollars to find
    out this shock finding are a bit cheesed off as they thought the survey
    would say the exact opposite!!!!! But the people that got the money to do
    the survey (Called "HomeNet"- tells you quite a lot, doesn't it?!?!?) must
    be laughing!!!!</p>
    <p>Be careful- apparently clicking this link may make you ONE PER-CENT
      MORE DEPRESSED and 0.4 PER-CENT MORE LONELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p><a href="http://spyglass1.sjmercury.com/br/eaking/docs/041297.htm">http://spyglass1.sjmercury.com/br/eaking/docs/041297.htm</a></p>
    <p>Mind you, the average survey margin of error is usually a bit more
      than 1 per-cent, so it might go either way!!!</p>

  <a name="240"></a>
  <h2>... But internet Shops want to make you happy!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, one bunch who are going to be a bit annoyed by the above survey are
    the internet commerce dudes, who according to the following article are
    depending on the emotions of the average web-surfer!!! Apparently they're
    using stuff like br/and names and nice web-sites to make the surfers happy
    to part with their money!!! The only problem is that now you can get
    internet shopping search engines (See <a href="6.html#188"> issue 6</a>...)
    to search for the lowest price, which throws their strategy out of the
    window!!!!!! So I reckon if "HomeNet" did a survey on them, it would be
    found that working in Internet commerce makes you sad and lonely!!!!</p>

  <h2>Block ads!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you're getting steadily chesed off by all those ads that appear on
    web pages and take ages to download, then you might be really interested
    to know that there are websites and programs to block them!!!! Ad companies
    are apparently not too worried about these ad-blockers,
    mainly because not really many people know about them, which is
    a bit stupid, because stories like the one below are going to
    make people know about them, aren't they?!?!?</p>

  <p>Well, that story rather diplomatically omits to tell you where to

    It Cool News</b>, inbetween (as usual) saying how "cool" he thinks the movie
    could be, he's managed to find the time to actually interview Peter Jackson
    about it, and get him to answer various viewer questions about the project!!!
    And guess what- someone asks how gory it's going to be!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Loads of Usenet cancels!!</h2>
  <p>Have you been on Usenet recently, and noticed no-one was posting on your
    group?!?!?! Well, your newsgroup might have been the victims of the zillions
    of cancel messages that have been going around Usenet of late!!! Apparently
    some nefarious types are using some free crap accounts to cancel zillions
    of Usenet messages, and are getting away with it!!! The article below suggests
    that it might be an attempt to disrupt some newsgroups, but we've also seen
    a major flame-war session from a bunch of saddoes called "<b>Hell Flame
    Wars</b>", who basically conduct an on-going flamewar amongst themselves,
    and crosspost to completely irrelevant newsgroups, to rope them in as well!!
    We wouldn't be too surprised if a lot of cancels were going in their
    direction!!!</p>

  <h2>Negativland CD-land!!!!</h2>
  <p><b>Negativland</b>, a bunch of dudes who make records out of sampling
    everyone else, are not too pleased at the moment!!!!! Apparently their
    CD plant won't press their latest album, and won't tell them why!!!!
    The dudes at Negativland HQ, who have already slagged off the record
    industry a few times in various articles for fanzines and websites,
    say that record companies have put pressure on the CD plant because
    of all the naughty sampling on their album!!!!</p>

  <h2>It ain't cool now!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, he's been getting famous, and lots of people have been writing
    about him, so it was only a matter of time before there was a
    massive backlash!!!!! I'm of course talking about <b>Harry Knowles</b>
    and his movie rumours website <b>Ain't It Cool News</b>!!!! There was
    some rumblings over the news about Peter Jackson and the Lord of the
    Rings trilogy and Harry's enthusiastic reaction (Isn't he always
    enthusiastic!??!?!) and then the news that Peter Jackson was going to
    answer readers questions about the films on the site... Then his
    week his site went one movie rumour too far and posted some rumours
    seen in the UK movie free mag "Flicks" to the effect that the Star
    Wars movie had been delayed!!! As many people suspected, this was
    a crap mag just retelling an old rumour, but in the talkback section
    accompanying the article turned into a complete slag-off of the whole
    site, with loads of people going right ahead and calling a Harry "full
    of shit" and a "sellout"!!! Not that they're jealous of the site or
    Harry's new found fame or anything...</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2013#5916">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/tb_display.cgi?id=2013#5916</a></p>
  <p>Some of them are also posting under false names as well...</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2027&next=1">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2027&next=1</a></p>
  <p> Personally I don't think the site has changed that much since the revamp in 
    story terms... Harry always used to go on about everything being "cool", 
    and I'm pretty sure older readers remember the "ZX Shrink Chamber" 
    story appearing the in the first issue of Senior Citizen- that was 
    an untrue story as well!!! (See <a href="1.html#20"> issue 1</a>...) 
    The main difference is the adding of the "talkback" section to the 
    articles, giving free-rein to anyone that wants to slag off Harry 
    and his burgeoning celebrity status!!!</p>

  <p>When Wired news re-launched their site (See <a href="4.html#123"> issue 4</a>...) we
    were wondering when Hotwired were going to do the same!!! After all,
    they always used to be relaunching all the time before!!! Well, now
    they finally have done it yet again!!! Unfortunately they dropped Jon
    Katz's regular column (One of the good things about Hotwired!!!) and
    the "Dream Jobs" section. Now all that's left is Wired News, Webmonkey
    (The only good bit left now!!!!) and the really crappy computer art
    section!!! (We do better stuff in our demos, and we don't get arts grants
    for it!!!!!) Just as well the Newstrolls people moved to a new site!!!

  <h2>Confess!!!</h2>
  <p>Er, this is a strange site!!!!! Apparently, this is some sort of electronic
    confession box!!!! I don't know if it works tho- when I tested it by putting
    "I think the Spice Girls are really good musically!!!", it just repeated the
    message back to me and then did nothing!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Digital photo-faking - yawn!!!</h2>
  <p>There's been some conference about digitally faking photos!!! I'm surprised
    they had to wait until digital faking came along to notice that sometimes
    people fiddle about with photies!!!! In the article below, it says something
    about the FBI having "a 14-step program for detecting digitally altered
    photographs"!!!! Presumably step 1 is: "Does it look completely false?"?!?!

  <h2>PGP 6.0 in Europe!!!</h2>
  <p>This is interesting!!!! Apparently you can get PGP6.0 on a server in
    Europe- and it hasn't even been announced yet!!!!!!! So much for this "tough"
    US crypo policy!!!!

  <h2>Making a splash on the moon!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to sing "Raindrops Keeps Falling
    On My head" on the Moon in the year 3415?!?!? Welll, probably not- but you
    never know!!!! This week, some satellite probe has found that there's a lot
    more water on the Moon than previously thought!!!!

  <h2>It's a Tragedy!!!! (Doh!!!)</h2>
  <p>How about this!?!? Apparently if you take drugs and stuff in nightclubs, you
    become not very well!!!! What's new about that you may think... Well, some
    br/ight spark has decided to call the bit where people are not feeling too well
    <i>"Saturday Night Fever"</i>!!!!! I suppose they'll be saying next that if
    you take drugs, you'll have trouble "Stayin' Alive", and it'll give you the
    "hee-bee-gee-bees"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Erm, not quite the Diana tribute you might be expecting!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, everyone's going on about Diana this week, so we might as well do
    something for this "one year on..." tribute thingy!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, this is an "interesting" re-write of "Candle in the Wind '98" that
    was was done right after the funeral... Apparently the webite suddenly went
    down afterwards for a short time..... (Warning!!! This is definately going
    to be offensive to some!!! Apparently you're also supposed to turn cookies
    off...)</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/harlot.html">http://www.godhatesfags.com/harlot.html</a>
  <p>And how about this for an interesting "Church newsletter"?!?!?! Hmmm, I'd
    like to see what would happen if someone were to print out a few copies and
    put it in their local church in place of their normal newsletters!??!?!?!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/requiem.gif">http://www.godhatesfags.com/requiem.gif</a>
  <p>BTW the reason I said turn off cookies was that the above two pages aren't
    actually someone's idea of a joke!!!! The bloke behind it is a "Reverend"
    type person in the US who is apparently a bit of a right-wing extremist
    who pickets people's funerals, sends off invective filled faxes about
    people he doesn't like to newspapers, and acts generally like an all-round
    not-very-nice person!!! You might have noticed the very "subtle" URLs above,
    but according to the links in the page below, there aren't very much people
    that he doesn't hate!!! (Expect maybe right-wing nazis!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Ant &amp; Dec in decent TV shock?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might be fuming over that Ant &amp; Dec show replacing the
    <b>Chart Show</b> on saturday mornings- but there's one bright spark in
    the gloom!!!! The hilariously titled "<b>SMTV://Live</b>" will include the
    very first terrestrial TV broadcast of the brilliant cartoon "<b>Cow
    &amp; Chicken</b>"!!!!!! This is great!!! If they can get away with putting
    "Cow & Chicken" (Which is only slightly more gross than "Ren & Stimpy"!!!)
    on in the mornings, then it won't be long before the other brilliant
    <b>Cartoon Network</b> creations such as "<b>Dexters Lab</b>" and "<b>Johnny
    bravo</b>" come along to grace our screens!!!! On the other hand, if all the
    parents start complaining, it may be the only chance you get to see it on
    terrestrial TV!!!</p>
