    <h1>Dress up in 'Planet of the Apes' costumes, then greet John Glenn when he comes back!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Have you noticed?!?!?!? Yes, we've got a banner at the top of the webpage
      now!!!!! That means that loads of people are going to see our spiffy banner!!!!! What
      do you mean, you can't see it?!?!?! OK then, go here:
    <p>
      <a href="{{ "/features/citizen/banners/citizen.gif" | relative_url }}">http://seniordads.atari.org/features/citizen/banners/citizen.gif</a>
    </p>
      You might have also noticed that we've got another name as well as the <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org">http://seniordads.home.ml.org</a> one!!!!!
      In fact, we've had the <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> name for a couple of months now, but we haven't used as
      much because originally it wasn't able to handle additional directories appended to the
      name... But now it can!!!!!! And as the dude from DHS said on IRC, it's less likely to
      be down than the home.ml.org address, so if the home.ml.org addr doesn't work, try
      replacing it with "atari.org"!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>We're the MP3 Crew!!!!!</h2>
  <p>At the same time as the record companies are going mad about this MP3 acting like it
    was the new "casette tape" or something big like that, a whole load of companies who
    actually use MP3 are banding together to promote the format!!!!!!! GoodNoise, MP3.com,
    MusicMatch, and Xing Technology, and Diamond Multimedia are the dudes together and say:
    "Three cheers for MP3!!!!!!!!!" Oddly enough, one of them, Diamond Multimedia, are the
    people who made the Rio MP3 player that's got right up the collective nose of the
    American Recording industry!!!!!! (See <a href="13.html#362">issue 13</a>...)</p>

  <h2>A 'GNU' type of music!??!?!? (DOH!!!!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, while the record industry people are fighting over the
    various new technologies and what they mean to the transmission
    of music, a new type of music has been launched!!!!!! <b>Free
    Music</b> is a kind of equivalent of those funny "open source"
    thingies you get in the Linux world!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp/">http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp/</a>
  <p>Meanwhile, the various possibilities of the net for music
    distribution have been espoused by none other than Todd Rungren,
    the producer of "Bat Out of Hell" and records by Grand Funk
    Railroad!!!!!!! I suppose when he releases his record on the net,
    then it'll be downloaded quicker than a Bat Out of Hell!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Now the news- with added blue bits!!!!</h2>
  <p>Wired News has changed it's look yet again!!!!! (See <a href="4.html#123">issue 4</a>...)
    However, it's only a slight change, as the links colour has been changed to a funny
    shade of blue!!!! Perhaps they are trying to attract more conservative sort of
    reader?!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
  <p>Another thing we've noticed is that they've started dividing longer articles into
    seperate pages, like their old articles in Hotwired!!!!!! Look at this story about
    those two Ant movies...</p>

  <h2>Search Engines for Search Engines!!!!</h2>
  <p>Search Engines are really brilliant, aren't they?!?!??! The only problem is that
    there's loads of them, and each of them are good in their own way!!!!! So wouldn't it
    be really great if they were all combined!?!?!? Well, there are a couple of websites
    that do this!!!!!! The best one we've seen around is given the really funky name of
    "<b>DogPile</b>", which is really cool, because it goes around a "pile" of search engines
    like a very eager "dog" to get it's results!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.dogpile.com/">http://www.dogpile.com/</a></p>
  <p>Now there's even personal search engine programs, which also compile results from zillionz
    of searchies!!!!! At this point however, a couple of the "big names" in search engines are
    starting to get a little cheesed off with people using their sites like this, and are attempting
    to find ways to thwart these proggies!!! But it's going to be very hard, I think!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Hacking- in your genes!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some bright spark has decided that a program which is usually used for searching for strands
    of DNA in some sample thingy, where you're supposed to search for strands of DNA in, to search
    for hacker attacks on a computer system!!!!!!! I wonder what would happen if they're using
    this "DNA search" on a system and some hacker releases a virus into the system!!!! Would the
    "DNA strand" be viewed as real DNA or a hacker?!?!?!?!?!?!??!</p>

  <h2>Java Quake!!!!</h2>
  <p>Yes!!!!!!!! Someone's done Quake in Java!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, not really, but most of it's
    in Java, and part of the really fiddly bits are done in machine code!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.rebelboatrocker.com/main.html">http://www.rebelboatrocker.com/main.html</a></p>
  <p>However, they're not the only Quake clone around in Java!!!!! The old Atari demo crew, the
    Carebears have done a little game called "<b>Frag Island</b>" completely in Java, with no
    machine-code bits!!!!!!! If you have a reasonably fast computer and Netscape/IE 4, then this
    is a rather neat-o little game!!!!!! Only problem is that it's a bit slow on my 486!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Wood you believe it?!?!?!?!? (DOH!!!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>We've just found one of the best movie internet sites ever!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a site devoted
    to Edward G Wood, director of such classics as "Plan 9 From Outer Space", and that one
    with the plastic surgeon who does operations on a sofa, using such clinical precautions as
    bowls of hot water and towels!!!!!!!! One of the really good bits is a detailed list of
    continuity bloopers for "Plan 9...", so you can shout along with it, like it was the "Rocky
    Horror Picture Show"!!!!!! Except of course that there's no music.</p>

  <h2>Boris Yeltsin- a new breed of virtual pet?!??!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is an original idea!!!!!!! Someone has set up an online "Virtual Yeltsin
    Health Watch", with pulse readings and things!!!!! So it's a bit like a Tamagotchi, but
    it's Boris Yeltsin!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perhaps, someone ought to do a version for Bill Clinton,
    and then the Republicans can see when his pulse rate goes up a bit!!!!!!!!!!! (Ooh-er!!!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Want a light, Mr President?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Wow!!!!!! Some of those wacky Americans can be really wacky!!!!!!!!!! This
    week a couple of dudes were arrested for threatening the life of the US pres, who is
    Bill Clinton!!!!!!!!!!! (Just in case you thought it was still George W. Bush!!!!!!!!!)
    OK, get this- what they planned was... putting little cactus thorns with HIV and rabies on
    them into a cigarette lighter, so that when you light something with it, you get zapped by
    the thorns!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that's a bit stupid, isn't it?!??!?!?!?! I mean, what do they
    expect to happen?!?!?! Do they expect the President to be a heavy smoker, and then he goes
    to their neck of the woods, and then ask them if they have a light, and then they go:
    "Sure!!!! Just try this lighter here!!!!! (Huh huh huh!!!!)", and give him the lighter
    with the thorns in it, then he uses it, and get zilched, and goes "Argh!" and
    dies?!?!?!?!??!?!?!</p>
  <p>Somehow I think this is a little unlikely!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Free Computers with an internet account?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Now you might vaguely remember the people from AOL or Compuserve due to their tenadacy
    to stick loads of "Free Internet for a Month" disks on every magazine in existance!!!!!!
    But soon, they might be sticking free computers on magazines!!!!!!!!!! Apparently there
    is a move afoot to sell Internet connections, with free computers!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>If you're on the internet- you're an exhibitionist!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever got on the internet, and wanted to tell someone about the night you spent
    with Thora Hird?!?!?!?!?!? Well, I haven't!!!!! But according to this article, I should
    have!!!! Apparently the megamighty inpho supey-dupey highway promotes "disinhibition", or
    the opposite of inhibition!!!!!!!!!! So, you're more open online than offline, apparently!!!!
    Which is probably why I got sacked from Radio 1 shortly after I emailed the Controller to
    explain exactly why Shed Seven should not be included on the playlist!!!!!!! (Though I
    still think you can't get more concise than: "They're rubbish!!! What, are you, tone deaf
    or stupid, or something??!?!?!!?!")</p>

  <h2>Newstrolls makes news!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, we were impressed with the way the <b>Newstrolls</b> has grown since it was a thread
    on the HotWired bbs!!!! (See <a href="6.html#192"> issue 6</a>...) Already, the sites has grown from 
    just a daily list of news-related URLs to include loads of regular columns!!! But even we were 
    surprised when they actually had their own news story!!!!!!! It's about side-affects for a new 
    vaccine or something, but it certainly is a start!!!!!! How long before Newstrolls becomes the 
    Reuters of the Internet?!?!?!?</p>

    earlier this week!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Start the millenium off with a bang- literally!!!!!!!!! (!!!)</h2>
  <p>What would you do if there was a major atmospheric storm which disrupted satellite and
    broadcast communications all over the planet!?!?!?! Well, you would celebrate the
    entry of the new millenium!!!!!!! That's because there's going to be an atmospheric
    storm- in the year 2000!!!!!!! So if your computer doesn't work, don't be too quick to
    blame the Y2K bug- it might just be a major disturbance in the ionosphere due to the
    sun being a little bit burpy!!!!!!!!! (Bet you never thought the safe operation of your
    computer could be dependent on your nearest stellar neighbour having good table
    manners!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Ted Turner really knows where it's 'at'!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Who says "old media" have got it wrong about the net?!??!?!?!?!?! Why, even this week,
    Ted Turner, the big person who runs CNN, Cartoon Network, and that funny TNT film
    channel that seems to show "Forbidden Planet" and "Poltergiest" at least once every month,
    was saying that "content is king- even on the net"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Even on the net?!?!?!?! Wow!!!!!!!!!!! No flies on this person!!!!!!! So whenever you're
    falling asleep ater watching one of those umpteen adverts which tell you that CNN is available
    in some hotel in New Zealand or something, remember that content is king- even on the net!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>But is it hacking?!??!?!?!</h2>
  <p>According to this article, most hacking is usually an "inside job"!!!!!!! Er, call me
    pedantic, but if it's an inside job, then presumably you don't need to hack in from "outside",
    because you're not outside, you're inside!!!!!!!!!!!! So what exactly is being hacked then?!??!</p>

  <h2>Microsoft read Slashdot!!!</h2>
  <p>Yes, it's true!!!!!!!!! MS reads the haven of propeller-head Linux geek nerds!!!!!!!! At
    least according to this memo leaked from MS-land on 31 Oct!!!!!! Hence the title "The
    Halloween Memo"!!!! This "memo" is about all that open source stuff, and what MS can
    do about it- and the answer appears to be "take over the Internet" and do really
    really complex software that no sane person would be able to emulates!!!!!!!! The only thing
    is... Linux Geeks are already way ahead of MS on that score!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html</a></p>
  <p>When this info was posted on Slashdot on Saturday, the amount of responses to it caused
    a system overload!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/98/11/02/1120257.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/98/11/02/1120257.shtml</a></p>
  <p>Quite a few people on Slashdot wondered if this maybe a little hoax!!!!!! Well, it was
    confirmed by MS on Tuesday both in the print pages of the Wall Street Journal, and also on this
    story on news.com!!! Oddly enough, this is the only the first news story we've actually seen
    outside of Slashdot-land!!!!!! We didn't get a peep from ZD-Net or Wired when this first
    broke!!!!</p>

  <p>But there's more!!!!! There's now a "Halloween II" document!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween2.html">http://www.opensource.org/halloween2.html</a></p>
  <p>Amazingly enough, Wired News have actually bothered to cover it now that the second
    doc is out!!!!!!! This report includes the really funny quote from Linux Torvalds about the
    memo: <i>"It's fairly mild, and I got the feeling that the person that wrote it actually
    liked Linux, but maybe I'm on drugs."!!!!!</i></p>

    claims that all you really need to work in a post office is a "good brain"!!!!!!! Erm,

    featured in "Rolling Stone", which appears to be a US music magazine
    for "real people" with "real feelings" who like to listen to really
    dull singer-songwriter type nonsense!!!!!!! The Rolling Stone Zing clips
    even manage to make Madonna and The Prodge sound dull-but-worthy!!!!!!
    So it's with a bit of dread that I read that Rolling Stone have launched
    their own web radio station!!!!!!!!!! Ah well, if you've got trouble

  <h2>Scotland- in Space!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You know they say about certain stories: "It could only happen in America!!!!!" Unless of
    course, it didn't happen in America, in which case it would be a bit silly!!!!!!!! I mean,
    you wouldn't exactly talk about the ferry services to the Shetland Isles, and then say "It
    could only happen in America!!!!!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That would be really
    dim!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Erm, well, anyway!!!!!! The point is- there's also a type of story that "could only happen
    in Scotland!!!!! And that's because we've got wierd stuffy newspapers up here in Scotland,
    which for some odd reason pretend to be really patriotic and salt-of-the-earth-working-class,
    even though they're actually quite right-wing and written by out-of-touch "Voice of Reason"
    types!!!!! Which is really suprising, as they're all owned by gigantic "Ruper Murdoch" style
    media corporations!!!!!!! Oh no, I'm going off on a tangent again...!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway!!!!!! The sort of story I'm talking about are the sort of semi-humorous "Wha's Like
    Us?!??!" type piece that's usually about some unique piece of "Scottish colour", like some
    Rangers fan complaining about the council painting his fence green, or vice versa, or
    someone going on about Scotland excelling in something really insignificant!!!!!!!! In short,
    anyone who makes Scots look like a bunch of prats, you'll see it first in the Daily Record!!!!!
    (The Daily Record is a tabloid which was a right-wing Tory paper in the 50s, then suddenly
    became a right-wing Labour paper in the 60s, anticipating the Sun's recent change of
    direction by more than 30 years!!!!!!!!!!) Dammit, I'm still ranting again!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, here's the really really silly story!!!!!!!!!! Apparently a recent piccy of some
    nebula has a dark area which just happens to resemble the basic outline of a map of

  <h2>Watch the telly- on the radio!!!! Whilst playing the old Joanna!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If someone played the piano on Radio 2, what would you think!??!?!! Well, you might think:
    "Aha! This represents the future of interactive television"!!!!!!!! This is because of some
    clever people at Motorola-land!!!!!! Apparently, they've found that interactive TV can be
    delivered using a wireless and a piano!!!!!!! Using a "very, very interesting band" of the
    radio speccy-trum, and a standard called "Piano", apparently Motorola can broadcast this
    "hot" technology!!!!! Which is ironic, as apparently the antennae for this stuff is the size
    "of a thermostat"!!!!!</p>

  <h2>A whiteboard with a difference!!!</h2>
  <p>These days, you don't hear bits of chalk being screeched across an old blackboard!!!!!
    Instead, you hear big marker pens being screeched across whiteboards!!!!!! And you still
    can't read them!!!!! But, don't worry- your computer can!!!!! Or at least, it can using this
    spiffy new whiteboard, which is touch-sensitive, and can link up with a computer to make an
    "interactive computer presentation", where you project the computer screen on the whiteboard,
    then draw on the whiteboard- and it draws on the computer screen!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Will Loaded team up with Ronco now?!?!??!!?</h2>
  <p>Real surprise of the week was hearing that K-tel, the lovely people who make loads of really
    spiffy compilation gramophones, have teamed up with... <b>Playboy</b>!!!!!!!!! No, they haven't
    launched "Now That's What I Call The Best Scantily Clad Maidens in the World... Ever! (pt 2)"!!!!
    But they have launched an online music store!!!!!! I wonder if they'll sell compilations of
    the dodgy music used on porno films!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Here's an interesting site called "<b>Night-time lights of the entire world</b>"!!!! Which is-
    what the entire world looks like at night!!!!!!!! Only thing is... the entire world isn't
    in darkness!!!!!! Only half of it is, because the other half is turned to the sun!!!!!! So it's
    also a good guide to what the Earth would look like if the sun went away!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>MP3s- from a wax cylinder!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some of you MP3 fans might have noticed that MP3s files have this very useful little thing
    called an ID3 tag, which allows you to put things like the name of the recording and artist!!!
    Well, I say some of you- in fact, hardly any of you use the bloody things!!!!!!! I still
    keep seeing MP3 files with no ID3 tags, and filenames like "shed_seven-boring_toss.mp3"
    abound!!!!!!! Anyway, for the small minority who actually do use it, you'll soon have a really spiffy
    new version of the tag called <b>ID3v2</b>!!!! What's really neat-o is that you can stick in
    pictures and karaoke style lyrics!!!!!!!! presumably you can even insert another MP3 into
    the tag, but that would be really silly, wouldn't it!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, here's the really
    really really detailed specification for it... Look for the "TMED" "media type" setting!!!!
    You can say in your MP3 file whether it was tranferred from a wax cylinder or an 8-track
    cartridge!!!!!! Which is really useful, what with my record collection!!!!!!!!</p>

  <pre class="usenet">
MON NOV 02, 1998 22:08:08 UTC -- According to ABC NEWS' website,
Davis is the new governor of California with 2,136,058 [49%] over
Lungren 1,982,820 [46%]! Sen. Boxer has received 2,155,456 [50%]
over Matt Fong's 1,916,746 [45%] and Boxer has been elected to
another term in the U.S. Senate. Fitzgerald has easily won over
Moseley-Braun in Illinois! [57%/42%]! And Al D'Amato has beat
Schumer in New York City! 1,765,114 50%/1,475,697 42%!

And ABC is reporting all of this -- and hundreds of other returns --
EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST VOTE HAS BEEN TAKEN!

In what will clearly go down as the one of the biggest Internet
mistakes of all time -- ABC NEWS has suddenly started to report
Election Day results -- before Election Day.

A spokesman for ABC NEWS was not immediately available for comment.

The DRUDGE REPORT found the Election '98 results at:

<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/senate.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/senate.html</a>
<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/governors.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/governors.html</a>
<a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/issues.html">http://www.abcnews.com/sections/us/elections98/results/issues.html</a>

The ABC numbers are being mirrored at:

<a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/abc1.htm">http://www.drudgereport.com/abc1.htm</a>
<a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/abc2.htm">http://www.drudgereport.com/abc2.htm</a>
<a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/abc3.htm">http://www.drudgereport.com/abc3.htm</a>

"I can't believe that ABC has done this!" declared a horrified
senior staffer in Matt Fong's senate campaign office late Monday
night.

"Do they really hate republicans that much that they would fake the
results and put them on their website! They should be sued by
everyone they already show losing!"

The charges are explosive!

It is not clear what ABC NEWS hoped to achieve by releasing
"Election Results" on the Internet a day before the election.

One ABC NEWS source in Washington, who demanded anonymity, was
completely floored when showed the website returns:

"This looks very serious. I'm calling [ABC NEWS President David]
Westin."

  <h2>Digital TV is stupid!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Yes, it really is stupid!!!!!!!! Why?!?!?! Well, apparently if you want to do artificial
    intelligence, apparently "neural networks" are the thing to be trying!!!!!!!!! And apparently
    they work better if you do it on an *<b>analogue</b>* computer!!!!!! So digital technology
    by comparision is stupid!!!!!!!!!!!! What's interesting is that the bods here say that
    neural technology based on analogue computer can finally allow the implementation of a really
    old machine technique invented by that Alan Turing person, back in the days of black and white
    TV!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Tell it to my heart- in an MP3!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Another biggie name joins the MP3 format- Platinum Entertainment!!!!!!! What do you mean,
    "who?"!?!?!??! Over the next few months, the record company are going to start releasing some
    choons from their archives- so we hope to see some free MP3s by such big names as "The Band"
    and stuff from the latest album by none other than 80s popular music legend Taylor Dayne!!!!!!</p>
  <p>I can't wait!!!!!! But I probably will have to- as I have a rubbish net connection!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Adaptec &amp; Liquid Audio say: Burn It!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As someone who's recently added a CD recorder contraption to their PC, (Which I call James
    Dean, on account of it crashing a lot!!!! As opposed to Godzilla, the machine which actually
    compiles each issue of this esteemed publication!!!!!!!) I find this rather interesting!!!!
    Adaptec &amp; Liquid Audio have teamed up for yet another "music on demand" scheme, but this one
    is different, because it's aimed at people who have CD recorders!!! What happens is that you
    go to this lot's webpage, and download the proggy- this proggy then can allow you to download
    music for a small fee, and burn it onto a CD using your own recorder!!!!!!!!! Of course, you
    could always make up your own chunes and burn them into your own CD etc., ...</p>

  <h2>Hedy Lammar vs Corel!!!!</h2>
  <p>When I was a young man, there was this really glamourous young maiden from the movies called
    Hedy Lammar!!!!!!!!! No, she wasn't Mark Lammar's mum, she was someone
    completely different, and anyway, she was a talented film actress and inventor!!!
    Erm, anyway!!!!! She's suing Corel software because they put a likeness of
    her on the cover of Corel Draw 8, without her permission!!!! A lot of
    people are surprised to how "aggressive" Corel are at defending
    themselves!!!!! What they might forget is that Hedy Lammar also sued Mel
    Gibson after he did that character called *<b>Hedly</b>* Lammar in the film
    "Blazing Saddles"!!!!!! So they're probably just getting back at her
    because she's such an obvious spoilsport!!!!!</p>

  <p>Yes, that's right!!!!!! According to this website, you can buy quantities of the highly
    toxic radioactive substance, at a bargain bin price of "$5.45 per milligram"!!!! If that
    sounds a little expensive, remember that a milligram of it is enough to cause cancer!!!!
    So if you have a business competitor or someone else you want to get rid of, it doesn't
    sound that much does it?!?!?!?!?!? And remember, as this website says: <i>"Quantity
    discounts may be available. Call for current discounted price"</i>!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>I wonder what would happen if a load of people call in pretendening to be "Mr Hussein"
    from "Baghdad"?!?!?!?!??!!</p>
