    <h1>Sony Handycam allows you to see through clothes!!!!</h1>
    <p>Well, readers on email might notice the difference!!!
      It's now readable!!!! Yep, sorry for all that "two massive columns running into
      each other" type formatting on the last edition- I just took the HTML version I
      stick on the webpage and saved it as text file!!!! In fact, I had to alter the
      flippin' HTML page as for some reason it could save as text because of all
      the funny complex tables and formatting. In fact, the HTML versh might need
      a bit of 'WebLint', as there appears to be one or two odd errors that crop
      up, most notably the amazing propensity for the lovely GM theme by Mozart
      to crash Netscape if being reloaded from the cache!!!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I've made a nice clean template especially for email readers, so
      whenever I set the "issue compilation" rolling, it makes up a nice text
      version which manages not to wraparound like a mad wraparound thingy!!!!
      Next I'll probably try fixing the HTML stuffs...</p>
    <p>BTW I haven't heard any noises yet about the possible name change to "Senior
      Netzien"!!! Is anyone particularly opposed to it?!?!</p>

  <h2>Teensy proggies!!!</h2>
  <p>You want small proggies!?!? Well, this lot will give it you!! The Hughi small
    proggy compy (Aren't the first 2 words contradictory?!?!) is a compy to make
    a pong game as small as possible!!! Hmmm, sounds a bit like those 128 byte
    demos we had in the Atari scene at the beginning of this year, doesn't it?!?!?
    In fact, one of them was a pong game!!!!! Well, the PC dudes haven't got down
    to 128 bytes yet!!!! So, all you Atari people, go and show 'em!!!</p>

  <h2>ISS X-Force bust Cows 'orifice'!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, that was quick!!!! No point in downloading "Back Orifice" (See <a href="4.html#111">issue 4</a>...)
    now, as ISS X-Force have worked out how to detect it and stop it!!!</p>

  <p>Or have they? Cult of the Dead Cow, the really "groovily" named
    dudes behind the Back Orifice program have now released a Unix
    version, complete with the usual full sourcecode!!! Hmm, I
    wonder if we're now going to get customised versions appearing
    all over the place?!?!?</p>

  <h2>Careless email costs lives!!! (Almost!!!)</h2>
  <p>As we mentioned before (See <a href="4.html#121">issue 4</a>...), sometimes some people
    don't quite see the funny side of email exchanges where people
    threaten violent death in a jovial friendly sense!!!!! The latest
    apparent victim of this is a bloke living in Estonia called Martin
    Symons, who made some joke about someone being killed!!! Unfortunately
    the Estonian authorities didn't really see the funny side of it!!!!</p>

  <h2>Your body emits light!!!</h2>
  <p>Of a very low intensity though!!! Dr Gerard Hyland of Warwick Uni has found
    that your body's electromagnetic field might give off the odd photon, and
    this isn't actually a random thing, it's actually part of your body's
    natural functions!!! This might open a can worms, as this means that
    things which give off low electromagnetic fields (eg the microwaves
    from mobile phones and microwave ovens!!) might be actually interfering
    directly with your body's electromagnetic field!!!!</p>

  <h2>Email addresses to increase by 220 million!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember in Uni when you got a student email addr that was made up
    from your name and matric no and it was completely unreadable and
    really hard to remember?!?!? Well, that's what President Clinton
    wants to do to the whole US!!!! He's just approved a plan to give
    every US citizen an email addr!!!</p>

  <h2>We get on telly!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Yes!!!!! Well, according to a bloke called "Felice" who's involved
    with the Atari diskmag <b>Maggie</b>. I was on IRC on
    Sunday night (9/8/98) and here's how the conversation went...</p>
  <pre class="usenet">&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: did u watch anything of VH-1 at all today ?
&lt;OldFart&gt; feL: Nope- anything interesting?!?!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: yep, they visited the Senior Dads website and
showed off the <a href="../../../demos/airdirt.html">Air-Dirt demo</a> ;)
&lt;OldFart&gt; fel: !!!!!! What!!!!!!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: at about 2.30 pm, they did a 
'random' search of the web and came
up with your site ;)
&lt;OldFart&gt; Fel: Woo!!! Got a video of it?!??!
&lt;Felice_&gt; oldfart: unfortunately not - if I
had seen it here I would have taped it
for you. I was over at a barbecue at that
time today ;(
* OldFart looks for VH-1 webpages....</pre>
  <p>Well, I've emailed VH-1 to check.... And so far have had no reply!!!</p>
  <p><i>(If anyone has a tape of VH-1 on Sun Aug 9 between 1400-1500 - I
    think it might have been the "Clare Grogan Show" - could you please
    mail us at <a href="mailto://senior@forfree.at">mailto://senior@forfree.at</a> !!!)</i></p>
  <p>Meanwhile, if you have an Atari Falcon, you have a look at the
    <b>Airdirt</b> demo, as shown on VH-1!!!</p>

  <h2>How does a wearable work?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Believe it or not, they're actually working on it as we speak!!!
    <b>Sulawesi</b> is an OS for wearables, and from what of it
    that I do understand, they're doing stuff like adding in speech recognition!!!
    Oh yeah, it's using Java as well... Erm, that's all I can understand
    from the page!!</p>

  <h2>Get a Muddy for your Webby Sitey!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you got a website that looks really crap?!?!?! Why not get it
    entered for a "Muddy"!?!?! This is apparently some of sort award
    thingy for really crappy websites!!! Apparently if you win you actually
    get an award presented to you at some ceremony in San Fransisco in the
    autumn!!! So get cracking everybody, and look for really crappy websites
    in places far away from the West coast of the US, like Poland or
    New Zealand or somewhere!!! (Hee hee!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Home Alone 3- on DVD!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, looks like DVD is probably going to take off after all!!!! And
    the best sign is the announcement from Twentieth Century Fox Home
    Entertainment that they're going to release some titles on DVD!!! But
    the dead giveaway is the absolutely dire choice of titles- just like
    the early days of home video!!! Check this out: Porky's, Predator,
    Jingle All The Way, Marked For Death, Home Alone 3, and Hope Floats!!!
    The only decent titles in the whole bunch are The Abyss and Young
    Frankenstien!!! I suppose we'll just have to brave cheapo
    straight-to-DVD crap with the odd occasional gem for a few more years
    just like we did with videos!!!</p>

  <h2>Tama-fishy!!!</h2>
  <p>Virtual aquariums!!!!! That's the latest craze in US software apparently
    and Mindscape's Aquazone Deluxe is the piece of software we've got
    to blame!! The link below is to an article about some kid who's
    apparently as obsessed with her virtual aquarium as some people have
    been obssesed with their Tamagotchis!! (Or is that "Tamagotchix"?!? Or
    "Tamagotchii"!??! Or... Ah, who cares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>'Ben the Boffin' clone invents new encryption!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some little schoolkid boffin person cliche has done a 2048 bit
    encryption!!! His name's Peter Parkinson!!! Well, there you go!!!
    If you want to get into the news, just wear a pair of glasses, and
    do a 4096 bit encryption prog!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_145000/145179.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_145000/145179.stm</a></p>
  <p>Oh damn!!! Somone's already done a 4096 bit encryption prog!!!
    OK then, go for 8192 bits!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.jawstech.com">http://www.jawstech.com</a></p>
  <p>Oh no, apparently someone's done 16384!!! Oh well, why not try
    16383?!?! I'm pretty sure no-one will think of that!!!!</p>
  <p>Actually, the dudes on Slashdot think this "I've got more bits
    that you have!!!" stuff is all bogus anyway!!!</p>

  <h2>Lots of procesa power!!!</h2>
  <p>Talking of "2 to the power of n" type numbers, this machine from SGI has got
    2048 procesors in it!!! They says something about a "25%
    increase in bandwidth", but I would have thought that it
    would have been 32% because 32 = 2 to the power of 5 !!!!</p>

  <h2>It's too darn hot!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, it's news to me!!!! Apparently last month (July) was the
    hottest ever the world over since records began!!! Not in Scotland
    it wasn't!!!! But then that might be because the increased global
    temperatures are starting to melt more ice at the poles, and are
    contributing to a move in the Gulf Stream, which usually brings all
    the mild weather to Britain, and thus global warning might make for
    colder weather in the UK!!! Or so said some TV prog I saw recently...</p>

  <h2>Toys in a not-final-version!??!!?</h2>
  <p>They've already started on toys for the next Star Wars film!!! But

    They're toys from the original designs, and not the final designs
    used in the actual film!!!!</p>

  <h2>Well, at least it's not the millenium bug!!!</h2>
  <p>When Prove It 2000, a piece of software used to check other software
    for the millenium bug, was run on Windows 98, it said that 98 might
    suffer from a millenium prob!!!! Then the makers of Prove It 2000
    checked more carefully, and found it didn't suffer from the
    end-of-millenium bug!!!! It suffered from an end-of-every-year bug!!! Apparently
    Windows 98 leaps two days forward or one day back when the clock
    ticks past midnight on Hogmanay (or New Year's Eve for non-Scottish
    readers!!!), for every year they tested!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Who's got your name?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>When you're wanting to register a domain name, what if someone's
    already used it?!!? You might find yourself getting sued by
    someone on the other side of the world because you're using one
    of their trademarks!!! So some company has decided to make money
    off you by making sure that this doesn't happen!!!! You can search for
    the domain name you want and see if you clashes with any trademarks!!!
    So far, no-one's taken seniordads.* !!! (Don't get any ideas tho!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Hasbro buy Microprose!!!</h2>
  <p>First, Hasbro bought Atari, a company that made a computer called the Falcon...
    Now they've bought Microprose, a software company that made a game called
    Falcon!!! Seeing as they appear to really like Falcons, I wonder if they'll
    try to buy Scotland next?!?! There's a lot of Falcons there you know!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Just don't send the film to the chemist!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Sony thought they were onto a winner when they did a camera that could
    shoot in night-vision!!! Unfortunely when this "feature" is used in daylight,
    the "night-vision" works out a bit more like Superman's X-ray vision- on people
    that is!! So an average shot of a nice family day in the park shot through this
    camera will end up looking like a rather blurry old pic of a nudist colony!!!!
    </p>
  <p>For some extraordinary reason, Sony have recalled this wonder of modern
    technology!!! Shame on them I say- not that I'm a peeping tom or anything...</p>

    after all he's got green feathers!!!!!), he can still wish that he could fly, way up to the sky,
    and he CAN!!!!- with the help of the "first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen"!!!! Yes, Moller International
    (Don't they do those funny yoghurt and rice thingies with little bits of jam in them?!?!) have
    come up with this thingy called the M400, which is apparently better than cars and stuff!! "No
    matter how you look at it the automobile is only an interim step on our evolutionary path to
    independence from gravity." they say!!! I think the driving test for this vehicle would be a
    bit harder tho!!!!!!!!</p>

    uses a lot of big words!!! Get issue 26 of the diskmag anyway, because it's
