    <h1>The Phantom Menace!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Yes, that's what the new Star Wars film is called!!!!! What do you
      mean it sounds crap?!?!?!?! Well, what about "The Empire Strikes Back"
      then!??! Ha!!! Knocked a whole in your argument there!!!!!</p>
    <p>Erm, anyway- the setting up of the "proper" mailing list is being slightly
      delayed because we're finishing off our classic ASCII remix of "Space
      Invaders"!!!! It'll work on Atari computers, and probably the Pacifist
      emulator on da PC!!!! Anyway, I'm doing a couple of tests of a mailing
      device from the existing SDWWWHQ, so it won't be too long!!!!</p>
    <p>Incidentelly, this Grelb move I was talking about a couple of weeks 
      ago (See <a href="9.html#"> issue 9</a>...) seems to be taking a lot longer 
      than expected... It's already October, and Fresher's Week has just ended 
      at Glasgow Uni, and it's still not moved!!!! But it'll probably move soon, 
      so keep using the <b>seniordads.home.ml.org</b> address!!!</p>

  <h2>Mills &amp; Boon watch out!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever seen those crappy romance books by Mills &amp; Boon or Barbra
    Cartland, and thought "Flippin' Eck!!! The way they're churning that old
    tripe out, you'd think they're computers or something!!!!!!" Well, they're
    not!!!!! Because here's a *<b>real</b>* computer romance book writer!!!!
    <b>Personal Passions</b>, some wacky US Internet service thingy, have gone
    one step better than wedding videos, and have invented *<b>personalised
      romance novels</b>*!!! Apparently if you give them some money, they feed
    the details of you and your partner into some computer thingy, which then
    goes away and writes a romance novel!!!!! So now you can give your friends
    something that'll really make them vomit!!!!! (If they ever read it!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>John Katz- watch out for the Trolls!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well as we said before (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) one of
    the annoying things about the re-launch of <b>Hotwired</b> was Jon Katz
    getting the order of the Shanks pony!!! So it's good to see he's got a little
    spot on the steadily improving <b>Newstrolls</b> site (See <a href="6.html#192"> 
    issue 6</a>...) !!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://datanation.com/news/dev/katz/archive/">http://datanation.com/news/dev/katz/archive/</a></p>
  <p>He's also regularly on the <b>Freedom Forum</b> site, where he keeps going
    on about the reporting of that Clinton business...</p>

  <h2>Say hello to your new dental assistant- R2D2!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You might remember <b>Robbie the robot</b> in the file <b>"Forbidden
    Planet"</b> being delayed because he needed an "oil change"!!!! Well, if the
    film was made today, he would be delayed because he needed to reboot
    Windows!!!!! This is because there are now apparently a new generation of
    robots controlled by PCs!!!!!!!! They can do things like <i>"serve you
    drinks, set a VCR, even vacuum your apartment. "</i> I don't know if I like
    the last idea tho!!! I mean, if a robot was to race all round the house
    with my Dyson, whilst still connected to the PC, it would cause a lot of
    damage!!!!!!!!!!
  <p>It's not all housework tho... <i>"One dentist in St. Clair Shores, Michigan
    uses robots to talk to children when they arrive for dental work. "</i> Just
    as well they didn't use real people- that would just be too sinister!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Hornet archive shutting down!!!!</h2>
  <p>This is a real bummer!!!!!! The biggest PC demo scene archive, and probably
    the biggest demo scene archive of all is shutting down!!!!!! Apparently
    the organisers are all tired or something like that... No doubt there
    will be someone coming along to do something similar, because at the
    moment there isn't any comparable resource for the PC demo scene...</p>

  <h2>Jeremy Clarkson will be pleased!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever been in the car driving down the road and thought: <i>"Oh
    I'm bored looking at this road, I wish I could watch Countdown instead!!!!
    But I can't watch TV in the car beacuse the metal frame in conjunction
    with interference generated by the engine jams any TV signals coming
    in!!!!!"</i> Well, don't worry, now thanks to the miracle of digital TV
    some bods have worked out how to correct for the interference, and
    now you can watch TV in a car!!!! It'll certainly be an interesting
    experience to watch <b>"Police! Stop!"</b> on TV whilst you're driving
    down the motorway at 100 miles an hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Six hours- that's a long sandwich!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>But not just any sandwich- a DVD sandwich!!! No, this not some strange
    nouvelle cuisine as you might think!!!! It's actually a way to solve the
    problem of the length of storage in DVD disks!!! At the moment the DVD
    disks haven't been long enough on either side for a full movie, and so
    halfway through, you would have to flip over to the other side of the disk,
    just like on a gramaphone!!!!! But now they've worked out how to "sandwich"
    two sides onto the same side, and they apparently have increased the length
    on the single side to 6 hours!!!! (Yes, I know that makes it sound as though
    one normal DVD side has 3 hours and so is long enough for most movies-
    don't ask me why!!!!!!) </p>

  <h2>Heavy metal trees!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Can you imagine hybrid Poplar trees going to a Metallica concert!!!! Well
    that might not be so far from the truth, as these hybrid Poplar trees suck
    out heavy metals form the soil!!!! They're being used to combat pollution
    or something....</p>

  <h2>Yah boo sucks to Fraunhofer!!!!</h2>
  <p>A lot of people were a little cheesed off earlier this year when some dude
    called Fraunhofer put a patent on an algorithm to encode MP3 files!!!! Well,
    some Swedish dude has found out the patent doesn't really apply in his own
    country, and has gone right ahead and done an encoder using the "Fraunhofer"
    algorithm!!!!!!!! And he's even done it for all you Linux dudes!!!</p>

  <h2>Say hello to our new viewer- Echelon!!!!! Or is it!??!?!</h2>
  <p>The EU is a little cross because they've heard about this thingy that the
    NSA (See <a href="6.html#179">issue 6</a>...) have called <b>Echelon</b>,
    which apparently monitors all the comms coming in an out of Europe for
    "key" phrases!!!! Of course, the US denies it exists, but they always do
    that on the X-Files, don't they!!!!!!!!! Oh well, let's check if it exists
    or not: Monica Lewinsky!!!! President Clinton!!! Bomb threat!!!! Osama Bin
    Laden!!! etc... </p>

  <h2>Oohh err missus- your cache is showing!!!!!!!!! (!!!)</h2>
  <p>Yes, someone's worked out how to interface between the CGI thingy on a
    webserver and the Javascript on your browsey-wowsey in order to work out
    what's in your cache, and where you've been on tha W3!!!!! Only one prob-
    that sort of data is not supposed to go beyond your browsey-wowsey, so it's
    a bit of security prob!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Yahoo- the new Sunday Sport?!??!?!</h2>
  <p>Remember the good old days when the *<b>Sunday Sport</b>* newspaper gave us
    such classic headlines as <i>"Duuble-decker bus found in South Pole!!!!!"</i>
    and <i>"WW2 bomber found on Moon- vanishes!!!!!"</i> Well, we were extremely
    pleased to see this headline:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>"Adult Star to Dance Nude on World Wide Web Throughout
        Pregnancy"</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>What's odd is that it didn't come from the Sunday Sport, but <b>Yahoo Business
    News</b>!!!!! Obviously those stocks 'n' shares spots aren't getting enough of
    an audience!!!!!! Anyway, apparently the "adult star" (Well, I would be
    extremely worried if it was a little kid!!!!!!!) is <b>Tabitha Stevens</b>,
    who has presumably changed quite a lot from when she appeared as a kid on that
    lovely family show <b>Bewitched</b>!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>You got zapped last month!!!!</h2>
  <p>Are you recovering from last month's gamma ray exposure!?!?!?! (ooh-er!!!)
    Well, you should be affected, as a star from a quite a few light years away
    threw out a gigantic gamma ray pulse, which affected 7 satellites in orbit
    around the Earth, shutting down 2 of them for a short time!!! It even <i>"it
    knocked electrons out of the atoms in Earth's upper atmosphere"</i> !!!!!! Apparently
    the culprit is this star is called <b>Aquila</b>, which is something called
    a "magnetar", which ... er, doesn't this sound familiar!??!?! Oh yeah, we've
    mentioned magnetars before!!! (See <a href="5.html#166">issue 5</a>...) And
    in the story referenced, Aquila got a mention!!!!!</p>

  <h2>'What would Jesus Do?'</h2>
  <p>How about give you lead poisoning!?!?!?! There's been quite a few necklaces
    sold in the US with the words "What would Jesus do" on them!!!! Unfortunately
    they're made of lead, and not properly sealed up and can cause to lead
    poisoning!!!!! So for loads of people their fervent belief in the Son of God
    has cost them quite a few cells in the brain department!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Wait till they find out about the street-light problem!!!!</h2>
  <p>Wow this is new!!!!! The Americans have just found out about this brilliant
    little wheeze to use power lines for net access!!!! Why, we've only been
    going about this in the UK for a year or so now!!!!!! We wonder how long
    it'll take them to find out about the brilliant side-effect of this idea-
    it turns the streetlights into radio transmitters!!!!</p>

  <h2>Calling them 'shades' is a bit stupid tho!!!!</h2>
  <p>Whenever in the future, in that spiffy digital telly era or whatever, you see
    some "famous" person wearing "shades" whilst walking past the "papparazzi",
    who then trips up and falls into a plant pot, what are you likely to say!??!
    Well, you'll probably say: "Oh, he's checking up on his share options"!!!!!!
    The reason you'll be saying this is because "shades" in the future will
    not really be shades!!!! Sony had just developed LCD Screens which can be
    put in "shades"!! So you'll be able to check up on the latest news, whilst
    you're tripping over everyone!!!!</p>

  <h2>Network re-vamped!!!!</h2>
  <p>This is jolly good!!! We like <b>Network</b>, the online demo scene mag, as
    they're one of the few cross-platform demo scene mags around!! The only problem
    is that the server used to be really slow!!!! Now they've fixed it in their
    new revamp- it's a lot faster now!!!</p>

  <h2>Dead Hackers mail gets killed!!!!</h2>
  <p>We went on IRC last Sunday (27/09/1998), and immediately got quizzed by
    <b>Evl</b> of <b>Dead Hackers Society</b> about a mysterious crew called
    "<b>The Poets of Bombay</b>" Well, we just heard about this mysterious crew
    through a release we saw at the <b>Reservoir Gods Cwmvention</b> the
    previous week!!! It turns out that someone calling themselves "<b>Muhatma
    Ghandhi</b>" had mailed 20 copies of a 560K demo to Evl, and as a result
    of his full mailbox the whole system had come to a standstill!!!!! As a
    result, the demo is getting a plug on the DHS site, but he forwarded one
    of the mails to us. After working out how the hell to run the demo (It
    turns out that the demo is for an Atari Faclon using a VGA display!!!),
    we watched it, and were a little surprised to find a completely different
    demo to the one we saw at the Cwmvention- these dudes must be a little
    busy!!!</p>
