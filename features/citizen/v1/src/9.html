    <h1>Grelb is dead!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Some of the people on the mailing list might know about this
      already, but for the benefit of everyone else, it's been a bit of an
      exciting week for the Senior Dads website- or rather the server the website
      is sitting on!!! By the time you're reading this, the Grelb server, which has
      housed the Senior Dads webpages since 1995 may be out of service, and our
      pages may be on a completely different server!!! Of course, if you're
      reading this on the website, you'll know if the pages are still on Grelb
      or not, but they're going to be off the Grelb server by the end of the month
      anyway!!!</p>
    <p>This sudden move is not being made by us, but by the people who run Grelb,
      and the reason is academic politics!!!! As some of you might have noticed,
      the Grelb server was situated in the Glasgow Uni domain- this was because
      it was started up as a little project by Glasgow Uni students, including one
      of our friends, who maintains the SD site!!! Since then, nearly all the
      students have left Uni... Now there's pretty strict guidelines on use of
      facilities on the JANET network, so obviously sooner or later questions
      would be asked about the Grelb site, which was mostly used by non-students
      and had a lot of "third-party" pages (eg our site!!!)!!!! So just in time
      for the new term, the dudes at Grelb have decided to shut down Grelb, and
      relocate it to another machine outside JANET!!! This is supposed to happen
      on the very day this issue is released, but if it doesn't, it'll happen
      eventually anyway by the end of the month!!!!</p>
    <p>Grelb users have been warned that the new machine will have a lower bandwith
      connection, and that it's only really medium-term, so we might have to look
      for a new site ourselves anyway!!! (Anyone know of any site which allows CGI
      progs and server-side includes?!?!?!?)</p>

  <h2>Phantom porn on Lords website!!!</h2>
  <p>Looks like a certain infamous recent debate in the House of Lords has weighed
    heavily on the consciences on some of the priveledged senior citizens!!!! One
    Lord speaking on a compeletely different subject started off his speech by
    complaining that someone had broken into the House of Lords website and put
    some "disgusting" porno piccies on it!!!! Only one problem tho- no-one else
    noticed any "naughty" stuff on the website before or after he said
    anything!!!!</p>
  <p>Hmmm, well, obviously he wouldn't be mixing his bookmarks up or anything
    like that, so maybe there's a porno "soundalike" equivalent for the House
    of Lords, a bit like <a href="http://www/whitehouse.com/">http://www/whitehouse.com/</a> !!!!!</p>

  <h2>Negativland not so negativ now!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, the problems 
    between sample combo Negativland and the record industry (See <a href="8.html#246"> 
    issue 8</a>...) seems to be fixed now, and it's actually a bit of a 
    revolutionary settlement!!! As reported last week, Negativland found 
    that their new album wasn't getting pressed by CD plants, apparently 
    on the orders of the Recording Industry Association of America, because 
    of all their sampling!!! Now the industry have reached a sort of agreement 
    about the "grey areas" of using samples of other peoples songs in original 
    compositions... Although this idea has been kind of understood for years, 
    this is actually the first time it has been recognised officially by 
    a record industry body!!! So this is actually a rather important decision, 
    which will fundamentally affect the various copyright issues around 
    sampling!!!! Well done, Negativland!!!!</p>

  <h2>Quake- the text version!!!!</h2>
  <p>Quite a lot of friends I know are getting into this Linux lark, and putting
    it on their old PC boxes they made out of 2 year-old PC parts!!! But they've
    not exactly been spoilt for super-duper games!!!! Until now, that is!!!!</p>
  <p>Now you can get Quake- in ASCII form!!!!! Yes, that's right, Quake, with
    all the GFX drawn on a text window!!!! Apparently you need to compile some text
    rendering library with it, but apart from that, go to the URL below, and get
    one of the best games ever released!!!!</p>

  <h2>Old Fart in adventure terms!!!!</h2>
  <p>While you're running Quake in VIC-20 style GFX, you might be in the mood for
    another retro game!!! Well, how about the very first adventure!??!!? Back in
    the days before you had to shoot at loads of people in
    3d-texture-shaded-funged-virtual-reality engine thingies with big names like
    "Messiah" and "Bigger than Jesus" and so on, adventures were like really
    complex books with no pictures, expect that it was often very hard to turn
    the page!!!! Most of the actual coding in these adventures went into
    super-duper command line programs that tried to understand what the user was
    typing, and how to carefully steer the user into typing only a couple of
    possible things so that they didn't have to code an artificial intelligence
    algorithm, which might not fit too well in a proggy for a 16K Speccy!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, someone's done the very first adventure ever (Done in the days
    when they always played Kraftwerk every time there was something computery
    on the telly!!!) on tha megamighty webby inpho-pipe!!! Yay!!</p>

  <h2>They wouldn't be welcome at a Quantum Las Vegas?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, someone might have found why God "plays dice" (See <a href="7.html#201"> 
    issue 7</a>...) but us mere mortals are now working out how to cheat 
    a little!!!</p>
  <p>There's always been a little problem with making computers smaller and
    smaller- at some point, it's going to be small enough that atoms at the
    quantum level are going to add loadsa errors!!! Well, now some clever people
    have invented ... quantum error correction!!!! So now we'll be able to build
    computers even smaller!!!</p>

  <h2>Microdrives II!!! (They're back!!! And this time, they're ANGRY!!!)</h2>
  <p>Even without quantum cleverness, technology's getting pretty tiny anyway!!!
    For example, remember those little boxes of plastic stringy stuff that you
    used on Sinclair computers (eg the Speccy and QL) because it was faster than
    tape but not quite as expensive as a hard disk?!?!?! (Ahh, memories!!!
    "Wouldn't it be lovely if I could afford a 'Winchester' drive with THREE
    WHOLE MEGABYTES in it!??!?!?!")</p>
  <p>Well, Microdrives are back, but not courtesy of Sinclair Research, but old
    "Big Blue", who are of course IBM, not a porno website as you may be
    thinking!!!!! And unlike the Speccy Microdrive Class of 1981, it's not under
    a megabyte of magnetic coated plastic stringy stuff, it's actually a little
    hard drive with a capactity of 340MB!!!! It's also a little bit smaller-
    about 1 inch square!!!! So a "Comm badge" with built-in "Universal
    Translator" doesn't look too far away, does it?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Say hello to our new reader- the FBI!!!!</h2>
  <p>Monica Lewinsky!!! 
    Kenneth Star!!!! President Clinton!!! Iraqi chemical weapons!!! Osama 
    Bin Laden!!!! Sorry about that folks, but I'm just increasing our readership 
    there!!!! After the news about the NSA having super-duper hardware and 
    software to monitor email going in and out of the US for special "key" 
    phrases, (See <a href="6.html#179"> issue 6</a>...) it looks like the 
    FBI are getting together a similar little system of their own!!!! 
  <p>So there you are!!!! As well as all the link exchange schemes, submissions
    to search engines, you can increase readership of your website by alluding
    to "naughty" things!!!! I expect the UK secret services must have their
    equivalent... Erm, Tony Blair in sex orgy?!?!?! (I don't think they'll be
    fooled by that one, perhaps!!!!)

  <h2>Scientest to clone himself!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember that film "The Boys from Brazil"!??! Wasn't it a stupid name?!?!? I
    mean, it was about some plot by Josef Mengeles to clone loadsa Hitlers, it
    wasn't about blokes from Brazil, because they were actually all
    German!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, I was vaguely reminded of the film when I read this story about this
    genetic doctor bloke from Chicago. Not that he's a Nazi who experimented on
    living humans in a Nazi death camp or anything like that, he's just wanting
    to clone himself!!! His wife is to carry the cloned embryo!!!!!</p>

  <h2>The Internet might make you really depressed now!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you're not got depression from Internet usage as reported in that
    "HomeNet" survey, (See <a href="8.html#239"> issue 8</a>...) then you're
    probably going to get really depressed at the reaction to it over the past
    week, which has generally been either "No, we're not!!!!" or the sort of
    somophoric bollox that I last saw when I first came on the Internet in the
    early 90s, and it was dominated by "Age of Aquarius" type tracts from ageing
    hippy types based on The Well!!!</p>
  <p>Probably the best article of the week was from Salon, who at least 
    still have the "media" articles that Hotwired used to have!!! (See 
    <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) Their story pokes quite a few 
    holes in statistics of the HomeNet study, including pointing out (As 
    I did last week!!!!) that the actual figures are pretty trifling anyway!!!!</p>

  <h2>Babylon now Babel!!</h2>
  <p>Just as well I didn't tell that "Linux Babylon" story (See <a href="8.html#238"> issue 
    8</a>...) this week, as it wouldn't have been so funny!!!!!!! That's 
    because it turns out that the makers of the game dev system for Linux 
    have discovered that someone already has used the name "Babylon"!!! 
    They're now changing their name to "Babel", and they've also changed 
    their homepage!!!! However, I wouldn't be too surprised if someone's 
    already used "Babel"... I mean, we're talking about something that suggests 
    either "Tower of Babel" (Which was a rather good little game in the 
    early 90s for the Atari ST!!!) or the "Babel-fish" in the "Hitchhikers 
    Guide To The Galaxy"!!! (Which also was used recently by AltaVista- 
    see <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/</a>) 
    So, not really too much room for manouvere there!!!! 
  <p>Let's hope they find some name to settle down with, as their actual idea is pretty neat anyway!!!

  <h2>What's in a name- well, this crowd!!!</h2>
  <p>Our suggestion to the "Babel" dudes... Have a look at this site!!!! <b>Name
    Stormers</b> are an actual company solely devoted making up names and
    slogans!!!! You can actually download software from their website to make
    up silly names for your company or products!!! And they've got a
    consultancy!!! Just get an idea of how brilliant these guys are, take a look
    at these brilliant ideas we found on their website!!!!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"NO IF'S, ANTS OR BUGS ABOUT IT." ... DALLAS PEST & TERMITE SERVICES</li>
    <li>"FOX FOUNDATIONS - REPAIRS FOR THE SINKING MAN."</li>

  <h2>That missing 'Save' function in RealAudio!!!</h2>
  <p>As you might have read before, (See <a href="4.html#105"> issue 4</a>...) 
    Linux users have means to record proprietary sound formats... But some Windows 
    users might be saying "Why should Linux users have all the fun!??!?!?" Well, 
    lucky Windows users, you now have the chance to record copyrighted proprietary 
    RealAudio streams using some proggy called X-Get!!!! And it's a legit proggy as 
    well!!! (Well, it's been reviewed by some guy from ZD-net, so it must be legit!!!!!)</p>

    converted into any old format!!!!!</p>

  <h2>MUNG II!!!!!</h2>
  <p>One of the best sites on Grelb (RIP!!!) apart from us of course, and that "Meg

    site by a bloke called <b>Sam Kington</b> and the actual site name of this
    site which in this site resides was called "Mung"!!!! And it was a clever
    little proggy which loaded webpages and translated it using wierd filters-
    what was really clever was that the links would also go through the filter!!!</p>
  <p>Then that disappeared, and we couldn't find any equivalents on tha w3!!!
    (Which was really annoying as we were wanting to an equivalent on our site
    allowing you to translate webpages into <b>Doddering Git</b>'s "<i>k3Wl
    wAy33 oV sAy1Ng tH1nGzZz!!1!!</i>", and we couldn't find any code to rip
    off!!!!) Until now, that is!!!!! The "<b>Dialectizer</b>" also processes all
    your webpages into cockney, Swedish Chef, and so on... It's apparently done
    by some bloke called <b>Samuel Stoddard</b>!!! Hmmmm.....</p>

  <p>Now this is really funny!!!!!!! As you might know, certain "documents"
    about what the President "did" were put on the Internet in a rather
    clever publicity move by that Starr bloke (No relation to Ringo!!!!).
    Unfortunately the people who always keep going on about the morality
    of the "Prez" have also been the ones who have been pushing the
    "CyberSitter" type software which filters out all the nasty porno and
    "unconventional" ideas.... Yes, guessed it, the software filters out
    those "Zippergate" documents on the web!!!!!!! I think the phrase here
    is "poetic justice"!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Online 'sit-in' at the Pentagon!?!?</h2>
  <p>Now this is interesting!!!! Some combo called "Electronic Disturbance Theater"
    were protesting about something... (Presumably the high levels of boredom
    caused to the American people by a certain "investigation" into whether a
    politician told made-uppies and had a bit on the side, both of which are
    presumably new territory for politiicians!!!!!!!!!!!) Anyway, they did
    this by using a "java" program to do a "sit-in" on the Pentagon
    website!!!!</p>

  <h2>Several unimportant people shout about nothing really interesting!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Phew!!!! The phrase "storm in a teacup" could have been invented for this
    absolute non-story!!!! But I'm not talking about President Clinton now!!!</p>
  <p>Some people have been complaining about the state
    of <a href="news://alt.digitiser">news://alt.digitiser</a> !!! Apparently the newsgroup devoted to the UK
    Teletext "mag" <b>Digitiser</b> has got a large "noise-to-signal"
    ratio, contains a lot of chit-chat which is not really relevant to Digitiser,
    and has the odd people flaming back and forth!!!!</p>
  <p>Well, for most older Usenet hacks like me, it was a cause for celebration, as
    those were all the old cliches of an alt.* newsgroup, and it would mean that
    after many months it was finally an established newsgroup!!!! But some of
    the "newbies" have been thinking that the newsgroup is "dead" or something
    ridiculous like that!!!! Of course, it's in a bit of a quiet period because
    it's between Uni terms, and so a lot of the regular Digi fans don't have
    access to email, but matters seems to have come to a head at the end of
    last week when some person called "zygotes" sent an email to an awful lot of
    people saying he "deleted" the newsgroup!!!!!! Well, I didn't notice any
    difference at Deja News!!!!!! It later turned out to be a bit of a mess-up,
    and "zygotes" apologised, but the kerfuffle, a few people announced the
    group was dead and that they were leaving, and then "contraversial" journalist
    Stuart Campbell wrote a "outspoken" message saying he was leaving as well,
    blaming messages by a couple of people who had left the newsgroup long
    ago!!!!!</p>
  <p>To be honest I can't what all the fuss is about!!!! You "headless chicken"
    types really ought to relax, and take up Transcendental Meditation, like
    that young chap Willie Hague!!!!</p>
  <p>Zygotes mk 1: "I'm 'hard'!!! I can delete newsgroups!!!!!"</p>

  <p>Zygotes mk 2: "Ohhhh, I'm so sorry, I can't delete newsgroups after all!!!!"</p>

  <p>Stuart Campbell mk 1 on alt.digi: <i>"I think it's one of the more pleasing
    newsgroups on Usenet - it's popular and dynamic, and reasonably often sees
    some genuinely interesting and intelligent discussions about games topics.
    I certainly think it was worth getting it created."</i>

  <p>Stuart Campbell mk 2 on alt.digi sucks: <i>"We tried to give Digi readers a
    forum to have fun talking about Digi and games and stuff generally with Digi
    writers and fellow readers, and got mostly a load of irrelevant juvenile
    drivel, with the few worthwhile bits coming mostly from people who've now
    been driven away by the weariness of ploughing through all the shit.
    Therefore, I'll be joining Uncle Biffo in sodding off and leaving you all to
    shout it out amongst yourselves."</i></p>

  <p>Now my tupenny worth... It seems to me that the group didn't die because of
    any crap messages or general irrelevance, because you get that in nearly
    any flippin' newsgroup!!!! It looks to me like the newsgroup's just died
    merely because enough people have believed it to be dead!!!! I haven't seen
    any appreciable drop in quality or otherwise in the messages, but suddenly
    everyone's talking like alt.digi's dead and the suddenly the number of
    messages drop like a stone!!!!! If I were the "coroner", I'd say alt.digi
    has just died of "mass hysteria"!!!!! Mind you, with the college terms
    now starting. I wouldn't surprised if we get a couple of old faces back
    going "Duh, what happened?!?!?!"</p>
