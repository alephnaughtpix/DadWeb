    <h1>The saga begins: Spring 1999!!!!</h1>
    <p>No we are not going to mention that "trailer"!!!!!!!
      And we thought it would just be Linux geek propellor-head nerds who
      would go on about it, but no!!!! I woke up this (Friday) morning, and saw
      the flipping "Star Wars: Episode One/Phanton Menace" trailer being
      shown on Breakfast TV!!!!!!!!! I almost choked on my porridge in
      surprise!!!!!!!!!!!! So- no more mention of flipping Star Wars!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Erm, OK then... We'll mention it once!!!!!!! But at least the
      story is a little more interesting!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>OK, enough of the SW bull-doody!!!!!!!!!!! This is much more
      important!!!!!! The first story in this issue is story no. 500!!!!
      Yes, that's right!!!! We've now passed the 500 story mark with this
      issue!!! Amazing, isn't it?!?!!? Those people who said when we
      started that we couldn't last were wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Erm... Well...
      Actually no-one's really said that, because not very many people
      read Senior Citizen when it first came out!!!! But if anyone did
      say that, they'd be wrong anyway!!!!!!! So there!!!!</p>
    <p>Oh, and another thing!!!!! As you might notice from one of the news
      stories, you can't get through to <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> <b>OR</b>
      <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> at the moment!!!!! Luckily Grelb hasn't
      shut down or moved to a different server as they were threatening
      recently, so the special "long" Grelb URL still works!!!!!!!! (Well,
      at the moment, anyway!!!!!! Don't want to tempt fate!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Scotland The Raw- The Unofficial Diablo II site!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p><img src="graphics/pictures/500.jpg" align="right" height="43" width="80" alt="[Story no. 500!!!!!]" title="[Story no. 500!!!!!]"> 
    Anyone remember that funny political ezine, "<b>Scotland The Raw</b>", 
    that was intending to be a mighty Scottish equivalent of Private Eye, 
    and was launched with great fanfare in the Ecosse section of the Sunday 
    Times, (See <a href="3.html#59"> issue 3</a>...) released a rather uneven 
    debut issue a week late (See <a href="4.html#112"> issue 4</a>...) on 
    a mailing list, after which both websites disappeared, (See <a href="5.html#163"> 
    issue 5</a>...) only resurfacing briefly when we started sniffing around!!!! 
    (See <a href="7.html#217"> issue 7</a>...)</p>
  <p>Well, the Gamerush URL may still be down, but the
    <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> is back up!!!!! Only, it points to
    a rather different site- The "<b>Unoffical Diablo II Site</b>"!!!!</p>

  <h2>Make a Good 'Noise'- for free!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember our very first issue?!?!?!?! Well if you don't, then on
    one of the stories, (See <a href="1.html#26"> issue 1</a>...) we were
    telling you about a really spiffy idea- an open source MP3 player!!!!
    Well, you might ask, what the four fruit marmalade happened to the
    dashed program?!??!?! In fact, it's done really well!!!!! In fact,
    one of the big "noises" of internet music, <b>Goodnoise</b>, has given
    it some backing- and it's still open source!!!! From a commercial
    company?!?!?! Will wonders never cease?!?!?!? We wonder if this has
    anything to do with Goodnoise joining together with other MP3-using
    companies to promote the MP3 format... (See <a href="15.html#432"> issue
    15</a>...)</p>

  <h2>We've forgotten our name!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you can read this on the week it was released, then either you're on the mailing
    list, or you're using a bookmark, or you've read the news on the ad for this issue
    on Usenet!!!!!!!!!! How can we be sure of this?!?!?! Well, you we know you certainly
    get here through <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> or <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> ,
    because neither of them are working!!!!!</p>
  <p>Monolith, the lovely people who handle <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> have
    annnounced that all *.home.ml.org domains are down until 1 December at least!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.ml.org/status.html">http://www.ml.org/status.html</a></p>
  <p>Oddly enough, in the same week, all the *.atari.org domains, including our
    <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a>, from about mid-week onwards pointed to some
    company called Wireless International!!!!</p>

                senior/features/citizen/graphics/wireless.jpg</a></p>
  <p>By Friday tho, it was pointing to the <a href="http://www.kaliba-net.com/">http://www.kaliba-net.com/</a> , who host
    some of the atari.org stuffs!!! A news item on <a href="http://www.atari.org/">http://www.atari.org/</a> explained
    that there was a problem with the domain server, but they were nearly ready
    to switch to their new server, so hopefully it won't be too long...</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.atari.org/">http://www.atari.org/</a></p>
  <p><b>Update (22/11/98)</b> - *.atari.org is back up!!!!! So it's not as bad as we

  <h2>Antz- you can surf tha W3!!!!</h2>
  <p>Surfing in the saddle of the megmighty infowebby thingy is all very well, but these days
    you need an HD with 20 gazillion squiglabytes (Or even, "gigaquads"!!!!!) space and a
    Pentium Supey-Dupey Stealth Ninja overclocked at 3 grillion Mzh, which uses the entire
    polar ice-cap as a heat-sink!!!!!!!!!!! (And you thought global warming was just caused by
    fossil fuels, like lead in petrol!!!!) But people with slightly smaller computers might
    be interested in these spiffy developements!!!!! <b>PAndroid</b> emailed us to tell us about
    this nice little webserver for Windows machines that can handle CGI and things. It can't
    handle server-side includes (Like the visitor counter on the website!!!), but then, it's
    doing pretty well for a 42K program!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/tinyweb/">http://www.ritlabs.com/tinyweb/</a>
  <p>But, ouch!!!!! My Ears!!!!!! They're hurting from all you young people shouting: "But what
    actually flippin' surfing the web!?!??!?!?!"!!!!!!!!!! Well, you can surf tha W3 using only
    a single floppy disk!!!!!!!! Some of you might be saying at this point: "But, oh great and
    wise Senior Dads, we don't have no ST or Amiga, or indeed any computer from the days when you
    could fit Microsoft Word on a 720K disk!!!!!!!" Well, you don't need one of those, you can "do
    it" (ooh-er!!!!!!!) using a normal PC and a floppy!!!!!!! At least, if it's from this lot...</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.qnx.com/iat/index.html">http://www.qnx.com/iat/index.html</a></p>
  <p>How on earth do you pronouse "qnx" BTW!?!??! Everytime I try it, it sounds like a 1950s
    concoction for cleaning brass ornaments!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>It's 1999- let's pay money to Bill Gates!!!!!</h2>
  <p>According this somewhat interesting story, by the time that flipping St** W**s film comes
    out over here (In Scotland!!!!) Microsoft might be going along the road of charging users
    an annual fee to use Windows!!!! Given that Windows is used on most computes in tha world,
    it's a bit like charging computers to breathe air!!!!!!!!!!!!! So sort it, Mr Gates, before
    every poor person becomes a geek Linux nerd propellor-head as those ZD-Net people say!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Well, I think this is disgraceful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Surely that Prevention

  <h2>David Bowie- is his stomach rumbling?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, here's an interesting piece of a news I saw on the Planet Rock news section
    on C4 Teletxt (p481)!!!! Apparently Tony Scott is producing a TV series based on
    that funny vampire movie he made in the early 80s called "The Hunger"!!!!!! And
    the main star of that film, David Bowie is apparently to host each episode!!!!
    We saw this news repeated on the gossip section of Club 140 (p143), adding that
    it's going to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel, so it must be true!!!!!!</p>
  <p>We wonder if it'll be anything like this series we've seen on the Sci-Fi channel
    over the past year... Oddly enough, it's also called "The Hunger", and it's
    based on the film by Tony Scott, but this one is actually produced by *<b>all</b>*
    the Scott brothers, including Ridley and Jake as well as Tony, and it's hosted
    by Terence Stamp not David Bowie, so it can't possibly be the same series, can
    it!??!? And having seen the series, we say: just as well, because the one we've
    seen isn't really very good!!!! And this reviewer person agrees with us!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://detnews.com/SCREENS/9707/18/hunger/hunger.htm">http://detnews.com/SCREENS/9707/18/hunger/hunger.htm</a></p>
  <p>No doubt with this new David Bowie series coming out, a lot of silly people are
    going to get confused with the existing Terence Stamp one, and we can't have
    that!!! So here's an episode guide for the not-so-good series!!!!</p>

  <h2>Space station: boom, boom!!! Ion rocket: phut, phut!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As any of you might know, work has started on that lovely little space station up
    in, erm, space!!!!!!! Apparently when it's finished, you'll be able to see it
    from Earth!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iss/newsid_218000/218295.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iss/newsid_218000/218295.stm</a></p>
  <p> Which is just as well, because that that spiffy Ion rocket we talked about 
    before (See <a href="14.html#412"> issue 14</a>...) started off working 
    really well, then a very short time later, stopped working altogether, 
    and they don't know why!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>If you want to be a 'hip man', go 'ape'!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, one of the albums that's playing a lot at SDHQ has been "Fantasma" by
    some Japanese dude who for some reason reason calls himself <b>Cornelius</b>,
    after one of the characters in "Planet of the Apes", and refers to himself
    in the album credits as "The Ape"!!!!!!! It's a fabby little album which shows
    up all those tepid attempts at "dance/indie" crossovers for the load of
    patronising guitary bollox that they really are!!!!!! Our favourite is the one
    where he plays some old Bach tune on a whole load of little bleepy instruments,
    over a whole load of really fast breakbeats!!!!! Mind you, the one where he
    plays Kraftwerk's "Numbers" as a punk song is pretty neat as well!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>So we're quite glad to find out that someone's got a fan page for the Japanese pop
    star who appears to be inspired by the Beach Boys and Jesus & Mary Chain!!! We
    think there really ought to be more Japanese pop stars inspired by the Beach Boys
    and Jesus & Mary Chain!!!</p>

  <h2>What 'Star Wars trailer'?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Unless you have been on the moon, or sport a not-too-brilliant short-term
    memory, you'll know that this past week the first trailer for the new Star Wars
    movie started appearing in US cinemas!!! Ever since, the trailer's also been
    appearing all over the Internet!!! The most popular versions are the Quicktime
    and AVI files from the official Star Wars website, but we've seen a version of
    the trailer shot in a cinema by some bloke with a camcorder, complete with
    rather appreciative noises coming from the audience!!!</p>
  <p>One of the major groups responsible for spreading the trailer has been the
    dudes from Slashdot!!!!! One of their articles, posted a couple of days after
    the trailer started showing in US cinemas, noted that versions of the
    trailer were available from a couple of sites, and listed them!!!! Then loads
    of people added comments saying that they had mirror sites set up themselves!!!
    So this article suddenly became an index for all the mirror sites to the
    trailer!!!!!! Which is just as well, because due to massive demand, it's almost
    impossible to download the trailer from the official Star Wars site!!!!!</p>
  <p>(Mysteriously enough, this article disappeared from the Slashdot menu the
    very next day!!!!! But the article itself still remained!!!! Perhaps the
    Slashdot lot got a call from a certain film campany?!?!?!?)</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/11/18/0751258.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/98/11/18/0751258.shtml</a>
  <p>The easy availabilty of the trailer on the Internet probably explains why on
    the day after the Slashdot article the bits of the trailer were being shown
    on various TV news programs around the world!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Interactive TV!!! From Carlton!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could just "make up" a TV
    prog?!?!?! Well, soon, you might be able to find out- and it's partly thanks
    to Carlton, a TV company that's already rather well known for "making up" their
    programs, especially they're current affairs programs about drug barons or
    Fidel Castro!!!! The comnpany is going to be working with Granada and WebTV to
    make interactive telly proggies for us mere mortals in the UK!!!! I wonder what
    the programmes will be like?!?!? Perhaps we'll get an interactive story about
    someone from Conornation Street "making up" a story about Fidel Castro- on the
    web!!!!!!!</p>

    about it!!!!!! So perhaps you might be interested in this story, about a guy who,
    erm, was sailing across the world alone in a little boat and wanted
    to perform surgery on himself!!!!!!! So he emailed this doctor, and he told him
    how to do it!!!!! So, he operated on himself!!!!! And now he's okay!!!!!!</p>

    get on with it now!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, if you're investing in stocks and shares, and you want to make some
    money from them, what would you do?!?!?!? Well, according to this article, you
    would slag off Kenneth Starr, the "independent prosecutor" person involved in
    this "Zippergate" business!!!! There appears to be an inverse relationship
    between Starr's credibility, which is apparently going down a bit, and internet
    stocks and shares, which are currently steadily rising a bit!!!!!
  <p>Perhaps if Tony Blair ever gets a bit on the side, it'll help boost the

  <h2>Move over mice- here's a 'pen-like' device!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have fiddled with a mouse, or even twiddled with a Twiddler!!!!
    (See <a href="13.html#367"> issue 13</a>...) But here's a new computer input
    device!!!!! It's not really got a name, but it's referred to as a "pen-like
    device"!!!!! Does that mean if it doesn't work, you can write a letter with
    it to the manufacturers to ask for a replacement?!?!?!??!</p>

  <h2>This chemical's a buzz- literally!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Honestly, some scientests!!!!!!!! This little story is about some scientest
    testing how some chemical works... So what you might say!!!! Well, apparently
    they're interested in this particular chemical because if you put it on your
    tongue, it feels like an electric charge!!!!!!!! Wait a sec- how would they
    know that?!?!?!?! Have they been sticking their tongue into electric sockets
    or something?!??!?!?!?</p>
