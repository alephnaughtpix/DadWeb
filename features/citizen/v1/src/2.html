    <h1>'Cuban Boy' is really Noel Gallagher & Paul Weller!!!</h1>
    <p>Well, some of you managed to come here for the first issue anyway!!! But
      there's this "when is it going to be done as a mailing list"??!?! stuff!!!
      Look, I'm flipping doing that so shut up!!! Anyway, I've set up a little
      mailing list for discussion and stuff. You can log onto here, but just in
      case some thing funny happens, here's the hard way to do it!!!!
    <p>Go to <a href="http://www.coollist.com/">http://www.coollist.com/</a> , and goto the little bitty which says
      subscribe to a mailing list, put "seniornetzien" in the list name, and
      then put your email addr in the email field (well, er, I think so!!!)!!!<p>
      Anyway, my main acheievment this week is to totally abstract the story
      and issue format to hell, and stuck all the stories in a database, so
      I just need to run a couple of proggies and hey presto- fully formed
      issues of Senior Citizen!!! Now I just need to plug in a new look...</p>

  <h2>Bill Gates sponsors wages bill!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, we might be having all this nice Social Chapter protections and
    stuff here in Europe, but in the US... "Microsoft advocates enactment of a tax bill by October which would permit any
    employer to deprive any full-time, permanent employee of any employee benefit,
    according to David Stobaugh" Who this guy?!??! Well, he successfully
    fought a lawsuit on behalf of some MS full-time employees who didn't
    get treated as proper full-timers because they were put on the temp
    staff roll!! So MS is apparently trying to make their policy the law,
    so they can't get done!!!! Is this the first time MS have tried to
    "embrace and extend" the law?!?!</p>

  <h2>To boldly go where no HTML has gone before!!</h2>
  <p>Goodbye HTTP, hello HTTP-NG!! Yes, the "Next Generation" of webserver
    dynamics is here!! OK, I can see you're falling asleep already, but
    it means spiffy new things at the webuser end!!! Like, foreign
    language versions of your pages!!! (OK, you need to translate yourself,
    but the the web server can tell the difference!!) And some brilly transmission
    protocol called SMUX which speeds up stuff!!! Er, actually I dunno what
    I'm talking about here, but it sounds good anyway!!!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Estimate your chances of murder!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, in the capital of Country music anyway!! Thanks to Metropolitan
    Nashville Police Department you can now find out your chances of
    getting murdered!!! Just answer a few questions on a questinnaire,
    and it'll give you a nice percentage score on how likely it is to
    happen!!! The stats are probably a bit crap really, but I'm sure
    the Tourist Board are really pleased!!!!</p>

  <h2>Viagra mk 2!??!</h2>
  <p>It looks like there's a competitor to Viagra!!! Oh no, another flippin'
    wierd name to learn that will be used all the time...</p>

    Though they'd better be quick because some bloke is suing the Viagra dudes.
    He says it gave him a heart attack!!! <i>"No one needs to improve their sex
    life to die for it. I'm very fearful of having another heart attack. I
    regret I ever heard of it"</i>!!!!</p>

  <h2>Encyclopaedia Yahoo!!!</h2>
  <p>Encyclopaedia Britannica have exploded onto the Internet!!! They've
    obviously said "Right!!! These young whippersnappers are using this
    webby thingy, and not reading too much of our paper stuff!!! Let's
    do some really original and spiffy website that they'll take notice
    of!!!" So they've done a web directory thingy like Yahoo, only it's
    a bit more serious!!! Oh yeah, they've called it "eBlast"!!! Wow!!!

  <h2>First time on the web!??!?!</h2>
  <p>Like "Killer Net" said, you can get loads of pictures of people "doing
    it" on the web!!! And here's a website where people will "do it" for
    the first time!!!! Yep, "Diane" and "Mike" are going to be the people
    "doing it"!!! It's not a porn thing tho!!!!! "We're going to do this
    as tastefully as possible" the organisers say... But as the "Netly News" says,
    it's got the following keywords in it's meta tags: "sex, teen, virgin,
    virginity, obscene, taboo, Live, student, condom, condomania, safe,
    deviant, purient, nude, minister, church, voyeur, forbidden, tasteless,
    gross, naked." !!!!</p>

  <h2>Hackers to protest against bad publicity!!!</h2>
  <p>Miramax piccys are doing a film version of the book "Takedown", which
    was done by this security guy who caught a hacker!!! So obviously a
    bit of an unbiased account there!!! So a lot of people, including the
    editor guy of 2600, are a bit annoyed, especially since they claim a
    lot the events are made-uppies!!!</p>

  <h2>Teensy camera!!!</h2>
  <p>Lucent Technologies have managed to squeeze an imaging system and
    video circuitry into a single chip - just add lens and connect a video
    recorder!!! This means really teensy camera just like in "Killer Net"!!!
    Obviously some people are a bit worried about the spying possiblities
    of marble-size cameras!!</p>

  <h2>Play with your lego!!!</h2>
  <p>You thought all that Lego business was stuff you left behind when
    you got a computer?!?!? Wrong!!! Lego are about to lauch "Mindstorm"-
    in other words, robotic Lego, which can interface with your compute!!!
    Interestingly enough, they're looking for beta-testers!!! Unfortunately,
    the application form requires you to specify what US state you come
    from!!! So I put my full addr with country and so on, and selected
    Wyoming for the state!!! So anyone from outside the US, I recommend you
    select "Wyoming" as a sort of code-word for "If it's US only, why the feck
    did you put the form on the Internet?!?!?!"</p>

  <h2>Willy Wonky rumours!!!</h2>
  <p>There's been a few funny rumours about this one!!! There's rumours going
    on about a film based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!!! Yes, I know
    there's already one form the 70s, but that was rubbish! :) Apparently it's
    from Warners, and the original rumours spoke of a live version with
    Michael Jackson in it!!! But apparently it's actually going to be a big
    cartoon. In the link below, apparently the film will be a bit "darker"
    than the older film, which probably means that it's a bit more like the
    original Roald Dahl book!!</p>

  <p>Hmmm, someones decided to do a write your own story in video form!!!

    choosing multiple plot alternatives that lead to distinctly different
    conclusions." Shame it's only for Geocities bods!!!</p>

  <h2>Mozart's Musikalisches Würfelspiel!!!</h2>
  <p>Don't worry, I wasn't having a heart attack there!!!!!!! It's actually
    German!!!! It's actually an interactive "Musical Dice Game" done by
    Mozart in the olden days!!! Apparently you rolled the dice a few times,
    and a beautiful minuet would pop out!!! Now someone's done it on their
    compute, and you can hear the minuet on a MIDI player!! In fact, if
    you're reading this on the webpage, then you've probably heard one of
    the examples!!! If you were wondering why this page was sounding like a
    Discovery Channel documentary on the Rennaisence, now you know!!!!
    But if you don't have the plugin, you'll wonder what the hell I'm talking about!!!</p>

  <h2>First there were floppy disks, now... Floppy screens!!</h2>
  <p>If I said "LCD screen", you'd think of a little digital watch or calcy
    wouldn't you?!?!?! Well, how about this- an LCD screen that's about as
    thick as a thick page in a book!!! That's what "Gyricon" is!!! The dudes
    in Xerox labs (you know the guys that invented WIMP and stuff!!) are
    thinking in terms of electronic books, newspapers, wallpaper and so on!!
    And they not settling for blocky displays either!!! They're aiming for
    400-600dpi which is the same resolution as a laser printer!!!</p>

  <h2>Lycos: Wa ain't no portal, honest guv!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you've been reading US web news, you'll probably be flippin sick of
    hearing about "portals"!!!! If you don't know already (Don't worry,
    they'll be going on about it over here in the UK pretty soon!!!), portals
    are basically web-guides with big front pages with lots of subject intrest
    headings, which have lots of little sub-headings and so on... The best
    example I can think of is the front page of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a>
    Well, now that virtually every search engine and ISP in the US has a
    "portal", companies are now trying to pretend that they're not at all the
    same as everyone else!!! And first up is Lycos, who now deny that they're
    a portal- apparently the magic word is now "hub"!!!!</p>

    concealed-weapons permit!!! Wow!!! The congregations must get pretty rowdy
    in Kentucky!!! Not all the church dudes are happy though. One said: "Jesus
