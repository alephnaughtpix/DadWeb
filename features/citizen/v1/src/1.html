    <h1>Because we want to!!!!</h1>
    <p>What do you mean it looks a bit crap?!?!?! Look, I've got enough
      material for a flippin' issue, so I think I'd be better getting out an issue
      that looks crap ATM but is really brilly in terms of content!!! And I'm
      working on the look proper anyway!!!! Oh yeah, and hopefully, some sort
      of mailing thingy as well!!! So don't say I'm not bothering my rear,
      because I am!!! Look, just read the flippin' thing will you!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>'Mind Reading' computers!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Imagine if a computer a game could see how difficult you're finding
    the game, and adjust itself!!! Well, the guys at MIT are working on
    it!!! According to the link below, "researchers at
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab are working on
    computers that can "read" a person's mind by monitoring body movements."
    Unfortunately, being the boring people that they are, they're
    using it for more serious stuff like "effective tutors" or video
    recorders that "sense your boredom and fast-forward through the dull
    parts of a movie", but I'm sure you can see the interesting
    applications!!! One prob tho- if Windows gets hold of that sort of
    technology, and reads people reactions to it, I can imagine it
    becoming really depressed, like a sort of Marvin the Paranoid Android
    of operating systems!!!!</p>

  <h2>On the 10th aniversary of Acid House!!!</h2>
  <p>Who owns the smiley logo?!?!??! Apparently it's some Frenchie
    guy called Franklin Loufrani who did it in 1968 for publications
    about the Paris student riots and trademarked it in 1971, but the
    guy that actually designed first it was an American called Harvey
    Ball who first did it in 1963 for an insurance company
    promotion!!!! So it's a bit of a not-so-smiley business going on!!!</p>

  <p>Nothing like taking things to extremes!!!! Some blokes weren't satisfied
    flaming with another guy on AOL chatrooms, so a few of them turned up
    at this guys house and set about him with baseball bats!!! Well, some
    of the "flames" I've seen on the internet could be summarised in the
    word "Ug!", so I'm not too surprised some of these crap "flamers" would
    eventually start using their clubs as well!!!!</p>

My sister saw Geri Halliwell and Chris Evans coming out of a London
Maternity Clinic. The rich and famous often go to thgis clinic for
pregnancy tests, abortions and anti-natal classes. Geri was photographed
coming out of Chris' house last wek, and the photo was printed in the

I will leave you to rumour why they were at the clinic.</pre>

  <h2>Polish dude from Heaven's Gate!!</h2>
  <p>And you thought Heaven's Gate were a wacky bunch of Yanks that killed
    themselves because of a comet in the sky!!! Nope!!! There's some
    Polish server with all the Heaven's Gate guff on it now, and someone
    (presumably the person behind the server!!) posted a message called
    "I'm from Heaven's Gate" on <a href="news://alt.conspiracy">news://alt.conspiracy</a> with just the URL for the
    website!!! So if you hear of some Polish cult killing themselves off,
    remember where you heard it first!!!!</p>

  <h2>Another European Heaven's Gate?!?!</h2>
  <p>Someone's been really pissing off a lot of newsgroups, especially
    religious and conspiracy ones, by continally posting the Bible a chapter
    at a time!!!! The posting addrs keep changing, and are usually obvious
    made-uppies, tho sometimes he appears to be posting from xs4all.nl!!
    (ie the Netherlands in Europe!!) But last Saturday, it got interesting
    as the posting addr was
    <i>the_time_is_near@praise_God.no.domain.specified (nine days and counting)</i>
    So- at the time of writing, it's 2 days to go to... what?!?!? We'll
    find out on Monday I suppose!!! That's Monday 13th!!!! (The day after the
    World Cup Final- hmmm....) <i>(Actually, that's <b>today</b>!!!!)</i></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.interact-acc.com/news/dex_drive_release.htm">http://www.interact-acc.com/news/dex_drive_release.htm</a>
  <p>This "Dex Drive" thingy apparently allows you to plug in the memory
    card of a N64 or Playstation and allows you to read and write from it
    on a PC, like it was a Zip drive!! Apparently console fans will be able
    to swap high scores and other things that "will revolutionize console

  <p>"Ain't It Cool News" has given us a quick peek at what Disney
    has been doing with their computer graphics!!!! Apparently
    the pics in the link below come from a film they're working
    on called "Dinosaurs", and the pics show- Dinosaurs!!! Done in
    computer graphics!!! Dunno about that excuse to do with them

    form his own company called "ION Storm" (Wow!! Great name!!!),
    has done some new game thingy called "Daikatana". Don't ask me
    how to pronounce that though!!! In the link below, you can
    see a piccy of the thingy (Don't look like Wolfy/Doom/Quake at
    all!!!), and a piccy of some hairy Jeff Minter lookalike!!!</p>

  <p>Awww, now this really warms the cockles of my heart!!! Motorola
    and the dudes that make the PalmPilot (3Com!!) have got together
    to offer "wireless messaging" for the little Palm Pilot computers!!
    You get this "Synapse pager card" thingy, and plug into your
    compute!! Well, it's a little easier than juggling between a
    palm computer and a mobile!!! So, how long before we get actual
    modem thingies?!?!? Who knows?!?!</p>

  <h2>Move over Jupiter!!!</h2>
  <p>Some French astronomers have found a planet roughly 3 times the size
    of Jupiter about 60 light years away form here!! It's called "Gliese 614",
    but I've decided it should really be called "Big Blob" because it's
    really big and like Jupiter it's a big blob of soft stuff!!!</p>

  <h2>World Cup Virus!!</h2>
  <p>Oh yeah, the French did reasonably well too here I gather... Anyway, if
    you were sick of the World Cup, you'll be even sicker if you use
    MS Word!!! "W97M/WorldCup98" is another variation of the world's
    most popular strain of virus, MS Word Basic Macro Viruses!! This
    one apparently will add a couple of lines to your autoexec.bat
    to format your HD on the day of the World Cup final!!! Even
    wackier, on the day, a dialog appears asking what team you
    support, and if you pick one the virus writers like, you get
    a congratulations message!!! (It still does the dirty though!!!)</p>

  <h2>Realplayer Killer!!!!</h2>
  <p>Apparently Real Player, that spiffy little audio/visual player thingy

    completely lock up someone's Real Player app!!!</p>

    remember those "do your own thing" type books where you came to some
    conundrum at the end of one page and you've got to turn to page xx
    according to what decision you make and so on?!?!? Well, it's pretty
    easy to do on the web!!! And now they can be self writing!!! On the
    one below if you get to the end of a path, you can add your own bit and
    choices to it!!!</p>

  <h2>Moby Dick predicts the future!!!!</h2>
  <p>OK, this is an old one, but I was reminded of it in this months Fortean
    Times... You've probably heard of that book "The Bible Code" by Michael
    Drosnin, where he says the Bible predicts this, that, and everything
    else inbetween!!! Now, some people think it's just chance that certain
    letters equally spaced between each other just happen to make well known
    names and stuff!!! In his defence Drosnin said <i>"When my critics find a
    message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby
    Dick, I'll believe them"</i>. This is a reference to the claim that the
    assassination of Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin was predicted in the Bible!!!
    Well, someone's taken him up on it!!!! And they've found loadsa
    people in Moby Dick, including Yitzhak Rabin, who were assassinated after
    the book was published!!!</p>

  <p>It seems that the latest challenge in demos, after the craze earlier
    in the year for 128 byte demos (Check <a href="../../../demos/dadplazz.html">ours</A> out!!!) is system friendly
    demos!!! The Black Lotus have already done a Windows 95 demo
    and now some guys on our favourite platform have done an Atari GEM
    demo!! You'll need an 68030 Atari with 16bit graphics (eg a Faclon!!)
    to run it though!!! What's really interesting about this one is that
    the crew are working on a third party module format so that others
    can slot in their own demo modules!!!</p>

  <h2>MP3 for Free?!?!</h2>
  <p>There's a new MP3 player just getting underway called "FreeAMP"- Yep,
    that's right!!! It's "Free", because it's GPLed. If you dunno what
    that means, it just means you get the source code with it!!! This is how they
    usually do things in the world of Unix, but this proggy is done for
    Windows as well as Unix/Linux!!! At the moment, it's still in a very
    early stage- there ain't no binary versions, so you have to have the
    right tools to compile it for Windows!! But since you get the right tools
    supplied with Linux as standard, it should be no prob there!!! Anyway,
    it's worth keeping an eye on- hopefully when my WinAmp player has run out,
    they'll have done a binary version!!!!</p>

  <p>Great!!! Our "<a href="../../..//demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a>" demo really gets a slagging in the lastest
    issue of Undercover, the Atari diskmag!!! It seems that Moondog has
    decided not to like our demos after all!!! Ah well, we couldn't get
    brilliant reviews all our lives!!! Actually, Moondog suddenly seems to
    be against all "fake" demos- why he's included us in it we don't know
    since we're art terrorist multimedia gurus, not a "fake demo" crew!!
    Mind you, the poor bloke seems to be negative these days about

  <pre class="usenet">From: Particleboard@tinlc.org
Newsgroups: news.admin.net-abuse.email

Scientists this week decoded the first confirmed alien transmission from
outer space. Here is the text of the message that they decoded:

"THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!!

Just send 5*10*50 atoms of hydrogen to each of the five star systems
listed below. Then, add your own system to the top of the list, delete
the system at the bottom, and send out copies of this message to 100
other solar systems. If you follow these instructions, within 0.25 of
a galactic rotation you are guaranteed to receive enough hydrogen in
return to power your civilization until entropy reaches its maximum!"</pre>
