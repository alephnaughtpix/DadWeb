  <h2>Wired for MP3 (Sound)!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember that classic landmark popular music videogram from the 1980s by Cliff Richard 
    called "Wired For Sound"??!?!?! For all you young people, it was a jolly 
    little song about listening to one's walkman!!! And the video was full 
    of really "hip" people on roller-skates listening to their walkmans!!! 
    Because listening to walkmans were really hip in the 1980s!!!! Well, 
    I wonder how the 90s equivalent of Cliff Richard (eg that young man 
    out of popular beat group Oasis- at least he can sing, eh Chris Evans?!?!) 
    would approach the 90s equivalent here!!!!! Some combo called Saehan 
    Information systems have done a walkman- for MP3 files!!!!!! You can 
    upload loadsa MP3 files from your compute to this thingy, and you have 
    a portable MP3 walkman, and you can put on your roller skates and look 
    really hip like in the 80s!!!!!! I can imagine the sort of songs Noddy 
    Gallagher from Oasis is probably thinking up like: <i>"Shaker MP3er", 
    "Do you know what I MP3?" "You Gotta Roll with MP3", "Don't MP3 Back 
    In Anger",</i> and Erm...!! I've run out of ideas!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.mpman.com">http://www.mpman.com</a> 
  <p>If you're a Unix person, you can use this proggy to upload your 
    files to the thingy.... </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.world.co.uk/sba">http://www.world.co.uk/sba</a></p>
  <p>But they'd better be quick, because <b>Samsung</b> is on the case!!!!! 
    According to this story from the Korean Times, Samsung, are bringing 
    out their own MP3 player!!! When a name like Samsung enters the market, 
    they must be taking it seriously!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/14_5/9810/t455166.htm">http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/14_5/9810/t455166.htm</a> 
  <p>Samsung might run into a bit of a legal clash with the American 
    record company moguls, who have already managed to delay one MP3 walkman. 
    But check this one out!!!! A UK company is planning to release an 
    MP3 player, which is actually a little PC running Linux!!!!! Because 
    it's a PC, it might skirt round the legal probs!!!! And since it's 
    Linux, you can probably connect it to the Internet, and run a webserver 
    from it to tell people what you're playing!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Chem Bros remix- in mp3!!!</h2>
  <p>And if you want something to play on your MP3Man, apart from Cliff and Oasis of course, 
    then you might be interested in this Chemical Brothers remix of some 
    Mecury Rev thingy... Because they've releasedas an MP3!!!!!!!! This 
    is courtesy of of the Ultimate Band Website, apparently !!!!!! Unfortunately 
    you have to enter your email addr or something, so just put in "po@tellytubbies.co.uk" 
    you arrive at this page!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/download/download.html">http://content.ubl.com/cca/mercury_rev/download/download.html</a></p>
  <p>Sorry, UBL, if you really want people to put in their email addrs 
    in to get the MP3, then don't put the downloads on a publicly accessible 
    page like that!!!!!! Of course, if they've got wind of this small 
    point, you may find that that URL doesn't work for you!!!! In which 
    case, you'll have to go here, and think of an "imaginative" email 
    address...</p>

  <h2>Nintendo can't be too pleased!!!!</h2>
  <p>Apparently The "Big N" delayed plans for their colour edition of the spiffy little 
    brick-shaped console piece of electronics magic that is the Gameboy, 
    (I still thought the Atari Lynx was much better tho!!!) because they 
    wanted to wait until technology actually advanced to the point when 
    the sort of thing they wanted it to do wasn't too expensive to produce!!!! 
    So now they're doing it- but if they waited a few months, they could 
    have used this spiffy little 1280x1024 colour LCD for their display!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Do U(HF) know the way to San Jose?!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, some people might be new to packet-radio internet connection, but we aren't!!!!!! 
    (See <a href="12.html#359"> issue 12</a>...) So here's another one- apparently some people 
    in San Jose are setting up a "UHF" radio connection wheeze!!!! Funny thing is... I thought 
    UHF was the frequency rage they broadcast the TV on!!!!!! Won't that muck up the telly 
    pictures in the area?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>More really good publicity for Linux games!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you spotty Linux nerd-geek-anorack-propeller-heads (As Future Publishing might 
    say!!!) will no doubt be on the lookout for new gamez to stick on your 
    Ultra-Stealth-Ninja PC "box" which will test the 3D hardware a bit more 
    than a console text display!!!!! Unfortunately one of the early ones 
    didn't last very long- which might have something to do with the fact 
    that the object of the game was to kill priests!!!!! Now there's a linux 
    game called Sin!!!! So we'll probably get some "expose" by the Daily 
    Mail two years from now about an "evil computer cult" called "Linox" 
    because of this!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Twiddle about on tha NetWeb!!!</h2>
  <p>If you like "double entendres", then you'll like this!!!!! We're talking about something 
    that a lot of people on the InfoPipeWebHighway do a lot when they're 
    surfing!!!! Everytime they point and click at a link, it's because they're 
    wanting to do "it"!!!! In fact, they can't really surf without doing 
    "it"!!!!! I am of course talking about using the mouse, you dirty people!!!! 
    But you can do something else with your hands, believe it or not!!!!! 
    You can "twiddle" with your "Twiddler"!!!!! That's because the "Twiddler" 
    is an intresting combination of the a mouse and that neat 5-key keyboard 
    replacement thingy that came out in the 80s!!!!! I notice you have to 
    "grip" it in a certain way.... </p>

  <h2>The atmos in this nightclub is non-existant!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Imagine for a moment that you actually are in the world of Mario 64, jumping around 
    and rescuing penguins or something, and then suddenly from nowhere, 
    someone plays "Because We Want To" by Billie!!!! What would you do?!?!?</p>
  <p>Well, you would of course say: "Aha!!! I must be in Waikiki in Hawaii!!!!!" 
    this would be because that's where the world's first virtual nightclub 
    is expected to be opened!!!!!! The one thing I don't understand is 
    why they put an exciting virtual nightclub world in Hawaii!!!! Surely 
    it would be better to open in somewhere not very exciting, like Bolton!!!!!!!

  <h2>Repeat after me: '%^&&'!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some Daily Mail 
    readers were a bit put "out" by the Teletubbies because they thought 
    that they might teach children to talk funny!!!! Well, most young people 
    today talk funny anyway, so I don't think the stuck up prigs would notice 
    any difference, would they?!?!?! I mean, these no-good busybodies really 
    get right up my noses, and ... erm, anyway!!!!!! At least the wonderful 
    tubby creatures didn't teach the kids to swear!!!!! But a bit of US 
    educational softs has!!!!! In fact, the programmer deliberately put 
    words like "masterb&^*" into a spelling game as a political point about 
    parental responsibility!!!!!!!! <i>"I wanted to wake parents up to reality- 
    here's what happens if you hand your responsibility to some machine"</i></p>

  <p>Well, if you're still not smarting from being called a "spotty Linux nerd-geek-anorack-propeller-head" 
    then perhaps you ought to!!!!!! This lot certainly would!!! That's because 
    this lot behind the <b>"Nerd Herd"</b> are fighting against <i>"*nix oppression"</i>!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Slashdot gets a kick in the pants!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well,as you might know, <b>Slashdot</b> is a really good place for finding pointers to 
    the latest news!!!!! But occasionally, they can slip up!!!! Like for 
    example in this case, when they posted a "joke" news item about someone 
    dying without saying it was a joke item!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://mandrake.net/1825258.html">http://mandrake.net/1825258.html</a></p>
  <p>After the furore, the "joke" piece was amended to say that it was really a clever 
    ruse to expose "problems with Slashdot's editorial policies"!!!</p>

  <h2>Flies won't like this development!!!!</h2>
  <p>Can you imagine a spider getting together with a goat to produce an extremely strong 
    material to replace the plastic used in fishing nets?!?!? No, I couldn't 
    either!!!!! But obviously some scientests did!!!!! These dudes from 
    Quebec are putting synthesised spider protiens into goats milk to make 
    ultra strong material called "biosteel"!!! I wouldn't like to be a fly 
    hitting of those webs!!!!!</p>

  <h2>And I thought my gramophones were old!!!!!</h2>
  <p>So, how old are your records?!?!?! 10, 20, 30 year old?!?!?!? Well, some crew called 
    the "Mayans" have a record that is over a thousand years old!!!!!! Obviously 
    this dates from the time before gramophones, so it's not available on 
    CD!!!!! In fact, it's in the extremely unportable form of a big cave!!!!! 
    These clever Mayan dudes actually carved the inside parts of the cave 
    in such as way that if you make a noise, the echo that comes back is 
    actually a recording of a bird from the local area!!!!!!! Pretty neat, 
    huh??!?!? I would like to see them try and emulate a record by Fatboy 
    Slim, tho!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Yet more really obvious Internet reporting!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, it appears that October 1998 is State The Bleeding Obvious Month in Internet reporting 
    terms!!! (See <a href="12.html#356"> issue 12</a>...) But here's something new!!!!!! Apparently 
    internet veterans surf tha w3 differently to newbies!!!!! And some people 
    even listen to music whilst surfing!!!! At least so says a presumably 
    really expensive survey mentioned in this story, but I wouldn't believe 
    it- it sounds just so ultra hyper wacky!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Your web page is on the line!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you *<i>really</i>* 
    want a different way to browse, how does this grab you- telephone based 
    web browsing!!!! Yes, thank's to these bright sparks, you can now surf 
    da web using voice commands, and then listen to "synthesised" web pages!!! 
    So in future you can shout down the phone: "Get me the latest issue 
    of Senior Citizen, my good man!!!" and, erm, hear it...</p>

  <h2>Freeper jeepers!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, obviously 
    the Republicans in the US don't have any equivalent of Peter Mandelsson!!!!!! 
    Or you wouldn't see this on one of their websites!!!!!!! This is the 
    <b>Free Republic</b> website bbs, and you should see some of the slogans 
    they've been thinking up for their rally!!!!! How about <i>"PERVERT, 
    TRAITOR, ALL THAT JAZZ / PACK YOUR BAGS FOR ALCATRAZ"</i>?!?!?! I think 
    <i>"1....2....3...4..... / get the hell out of the whitehouse you lying 
    sonuvab*tch..."</i> has a ring to it!!!!! Also, check out the banners, 
    especially the "pissed off" one!!!!! BTW note that they call each other 
    "freepers"!!!!!! I think this tells you all you need to know!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Renta-websites!!!!</h2>
  <p>We've recently 
    found one of the best sites ever on the internet- a latter-day equivalent 
    of the "Cool Site of the Day" type thingy done years ago!!!! Only this 
    one lists sites that are dead, or haven't been updated for years!!!! 
    The real specialities are short-term websites knocked up for movie publicity!!!!! 
    This week, there's a review of the <b>Mission Impossible</b> website!!!!!!! 
    Really brillibobs, eh?!?!?!?!? </p>

  <h2>If you HEAR Sid, tell him!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some of you young 
    sprites might be aware that "retro" synth noises are back in fashion 
    in the music biz!!!! Loadsa little boxes have been launched emulating 
    303s, 808s, 505s, 101s, and even the rare 123456789-0-123456789s!!!!! 
    But only now has it happened to one of the most popular "retro" synths 
    ever!!!!! No, I'm not talking about the Minimoog, or even the Mediumsizedmoog, 
    but the SID soundchip on the Commodore 64 home computer!!!!!! Yes, that's 
    right- someone's done a MIDI rackmounted box that faithfully emulates 
    the SID chip!! That means that soon you'll be able to hear dance records 
    with the distinctive "musical wasp trapped in a pipe and put through 
    a phaser" sound of the SID!!!!! Maybe there might even be an "old-skool" 
    type Rob Hubbard revival?!?!? (Now that *<b>would</b>* be really neat!!!)</p>

  <p>We couldn't believe 
    it the other day when we loaded a webpage from the <b>Geocities</b> 
    webserver, and no annoying pop-up ads appeared!!!!! Then we saw the 
    bottom of the page... Ho ho ho ho!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Now son- you've been hacking again, haven't you!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Here's a really 
    serious article called <i>"How to tell if your kid is a hacker"</i>!!!!! 
    Look, stop laughing you young whippersnappers!!!!!!!! This is a serious 
    subject!!!!!!!!! Apparently, according to this article, parents are 
    supposed to learn about computers or something... </p>

  <h2>Maybe the 'Snoopy' people are dieting!!!!</h2>
  <p>We thought that 
    you only got "Angry of Tumbridge-Wells" type letters in the UK, so we 
    were pleased to see the following letter in the <b>South China Morning 
    Post</b>!!!! Mind you, it's from Hong Kong, which is a former UK colony, 
    so that may explain it!!!!!! Anyway, the letter bemoans the fact that 
    MacDonalds are doing a "Snoopy" doll promotion, and loads of people 
    are buying loadsa stuff from the "Big Mac" in order to get the Snoopy 
    doll, then just dumping the food in the bin!!!!!!!! Sounds like a really 
    great advert for MacDonalds, eh?!?!?!?!?</p>

  <h2>Star Trek to fund 'First Contact'?!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Interesting news 
    of the week is that the dudes from <b>Star Trek</b> are co-funding the 
    <b>Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intellicence (SETI)</b>, and are hoping 
    to coincide the launch of SETI's new computer network (See <a href="4.html#127"> 
    issue 4</a>...) with the launch of the next Star Trek film!!!!!!

  <h2>Thinking map gives you comics!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, thanks to the wonder of Java, you can now see the cream of America's unfunny comics!!! 
    <b>Comic Explorer</b> is a rather nice big Java prog which allows you 
    to select from loadsa comix!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.comiczone.com/explorer/">http://www.comiczone.com/explorer/</a></p>
  <p>It's not just a gimmicky thingy though- apparently it uses a neato 
    thingy called "<b>Thinkmap</b>" which is supposed to be a really good 
    way of sorting data by pulling levers or something.</p>

  <h2>Reality Plus- or minus?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Well, here's a new 
    buzzword!!!!!!! You've heard of "wearables" by now... If not, read some 
    old issues of this organ NOW!!!! So here's one for you wearables fans- 
    *<b>augmented reality</b>*!!!! It's just like normal reality expect than 
    you can see extra stuff via your wearable computers... So it's a bit 
    like that dude in "The Terminator" then!!!!!!! </p>

  <p>Unfortunately as you might have noted in Star Trek, if you wear 
    a comm-badge, then Captain Jean Luc-pIcard can tell where you are!!!!! 
    So some people are worried that wearing a wearable might allow people 
    to pinpoint where you are!!!! Well, why not do like the Star Trek 
    people with their comm badge, and just toss it off somewhere?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Flat screens by 2004?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Amazingly, no-one seems to have noticed the true significance of this amazing piece of 
    news!!! Read the story below: <i>"Market research company Stanford Resources 
    predict a slow start for flat panel monitors, with CRT (Cathode Ray 
    Tube) monitors remaining the standard until at least 2004."</i></p>
  <p>So flat screen monitors may be common as early as 5-6 years from now?!??!!? Cor blimey!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Now you can tell Chris Evans to shut up- and he will!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You know that 
    motor show in Birmingham that the lady from "Watchdog" wasn't allowed 
    into?!?!? Well, one of the things at the show was a car- with voice 
    activated car controls!!!!! Luckily, only-non driving stuff can be voice 
    controlled (eg the radio, so you can tell Chris Evans to belt it!!!!), 
    but I still don't like to think how the car will behave if the driver 
    has some of that new-fangled "road rage" stuff!!!!!! You could probably 
    recognise all the angry drivers in a traffic jams, as their inside lights 
    would probably be switching on and off in response to their naughty 
    words!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Internet Tourbus!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is 
    another interesting "Best of the web" type mailing list, but we really 
    dig that name: "<b>Internet Tourbus</b>"!!!!!!! That's almost as good 
    as "Van Koevering Interactive Piano" (See <a href="12.html#352"> issue 
    12</a>...) And the subtitle is really great as well!!!! <i>"Why Surf 
    When You Can Ride The Bus?"</i>!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>And the final result is... Grtgykugfuyg RuityuY Bvxzbvnm!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p><i>"If we are paid only 86.5%, we will publish only 86.5% of our research results!"</i> 
    So says a group of scientests who publish their stuff on the web and 
    are currently taking industrial action over unequal pay rates!!!!!! 
    And they've published 86.5% of their results... by scrambling the other 
    13.5%!!!!!!! Yes, that's right- they've scrambled 13.5% of the page 
    on all of their webpages!!!!!! Now, that's what I call style!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Rocket in your pocket!!!!</h2>
  <p>No, it's not what you think!!!!!! It's actually quite small really!!!!!! Look, it's definately 
    not what you think, alright!!!!!! (In my case, it's not small at all 
    actually!!!! Erm, where was I?!?!?!) Anyway, enough talking about you-know-what, 
    I'm actually talking about a real rocket engine that you can fit in 
    you pocket!!!! In fact, you can probably fit quite a few of them in- 
    unless you have really small pockets, or are the size of an atom or 
    something, because these rocket engines are really small- 1.5 centimeters 
    by 3 millimeters no less!!!! The dudes behind this reckon that "array 
    of 800 microrockets (about the size of a hardcover novel) could carry 
    a 1,000-kilogram vehicle into space."- so we could be talking about 
    a rocket the size of a car taking satellites into space?!?!?!?!??!?!</p>

  <h2>Little Green Men from... Jupiter?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Well, not really, but scientests seem to think that a couple of the moons of Jupiter, 
    Europa and Callisto, (I didn't know they named a moon after that character 
    in "Xena: Warrior Princess"!!!!!) may have all the building blocks of 
    life!!!!! It's almost like that film "2010"!!!!! Except for the bit 
    about Callisto... And the monolith... OK, nearly everything's different 
    then, apart from the "Europa may have life" bit!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Jupiter may have competition!!!!</h2>
  <p>Jupiter isn't the only big planet around this week!!!!!! A planet twice the size has been 
    found orbiting a star in the constellation of Cancer!!!! Seeing as the 
    planet hasn't got a name yet, and the world's astronomical community 
    failed to take my advice last time, (See <a href="1.html#16"> issue 
    1</a>...) I will give them another chance... [clears throat!!!!] Ahem!!!!!! 
    I think the planet should be called "<b>Big Blob</b>"- because it's big 
    and blobby!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>How to deal with a stupidly long signature!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, I thought this was funny!!!!! </p>
  <pre class="usenet">ewsgroup: alt.music.techno

    Well, if we presume that each line of your somewhat-absurdly oversized
    (but intriguing nonetheless) .sig file represents 20 CDs, my collection is
    as large as the graphic is tall.. (what a pain in the ass way to answer,
    eh?)
