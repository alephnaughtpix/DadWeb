    <h1>Xmas- it's a blast!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Wow!!!!! We made it to Xmas!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Now you might call me paranoid, but... Don't you think the timing of this
      attack on Iraq, at the same time as the impeachment hearings, is a bit of a
      coincidence!??!?!?!?! Now I don't wish to be scaremongering or anything, but
      I think President Clinton started the attack to divert attention from the
      impeachment hearings!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>After the mailing list delayed the last issue by a couple of days, I
      thought it might be a neat idea to make up my own mailer proggy!!!! I'm
      currently writing the flippin' thing, and I'll be testing it soon...</p>
    <p>Anyway, Merry Christmas to you lot, and all that jazz!!!! Have a nice time,
      and make sure you watch the "Davey" Bond movie!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>I saw mommy... doing something very naughty to Santa Claus!!!!</h2>
  <p><img src="graphics/pictures/skate.gif" align="right" height="83" width="83" hspace="5" title="Santa's... DRUNK!!!!!" alt="Santa's... DRUNK!!!!!"> 
    Well, this is the season to be jolly, and how much more jolly can you 
    get than Santa having it off with a grown woman!?!??!!? How about Santa 
    getting extremely drunk, and sleeping in the corner like an old hobo?!?!?! 
    (Or "bum", as you Americans say- hence the hilarious movie title: "Halleluia, 
    I'm A Bum!" which "the authorities" over here took great exception to 
    in the 1950s!!!!!) Well, that's how this "Santanarchy" lot are spending 
    their Christmas!!!!!! I dunno how jolly that pic in the archives of 
    one of the Santas getting nailed to a cross is tho!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Presumably 'drugs help a lot' with this bunch!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, readers, you know how we are about drugs!!!!! It's not big and not clever!!!! 
    (Apart from the ones I use for my arthritis of course!!!!) So we were 
    a bit surprised to see the following on a <b>Zing!</b> (See <a href="17.html#551"> 
    issue 17</a>...) channel!!!!</p>
  <p> <a href="http://zgs-farm.zing.com/ISAPI/ZapServer.dll?Zap&CreativeURL=http%3A%2F%2Fzfs-farm.zing.com%2Fzing%2Fcontent%2F8000313d.dat">http://zgs-farm.zing.com/ISAPI/ZapServer.dll?Zap&<br/>

  <p>It seems that this is an ad for some "hip" art people!!!!! And it's 
      only one of a series!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>'Kvetch'- the word on everyone's lips in 99!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Kvetch!!!!!!!!! Don't worry, I'm not sneezing there!!!!!!!!! In fact, I'm informing 
    you of an interesting idea on tha netweb with really great potential!!!! 
    OK, I don't know what "kvetch" actually means, but it's the name of 
    a website, where you can view short and sharp little rants on various 
    subjects by various people... And about 30 seconds later, the site randomly 
    loads another one!!!! You can of course add your own rant to the mix, 
    and annoy loads of other people with your superior intillect!!!!!</p>
  <p>Now if that was it, it would be just a vaguely interesting site, 
    but wait- there's more!!!! That zappy <b>Zing!</b> crowd have teamed
    up with Kvetch, and have started putting Kvetch "comments" on Zing!!! 
    So you can put some comment into the Kvetch, and then some time later 
    you might be surfing the web- and your Kvetch comment suddenly appears 
    in Zing whilst you're surfing!!!!</p>
  <p>Now it doesn't take a genius to work out that you could use this 
    idea for something like an Internet noticeboard for not-too-urgent 
    messages- stick the message and a contact addr into the website, and 
    the messages are converted for Zing! or whatever, so that it can download 
    them, and then while you're surfing, you can see the messages, and 
    reply to them!!!!!</p>
  <p>Neat idea, huh?!?! So if you're thinking of it, Zing! peeps, please 
    credit us for it!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Furby- he's really cut up!!!!! (Doh!!!!)</h2>
  <p>As you might know 
    from previous issues (See <a href="18.html#543"> issue 18</a>...) that 
    we're not too enamoured with this year's big Xmas toy!!!!! so, we're 
    really pleased with this site!!!! Someone's actually done an autopsy 
    on one of those evil little <b>Furby</b> creatures!!!!! Brilliant!!! 
    So, if those little brats are snivelling on Dec 25 about not getting 
    a Furby, you can show them this site to really cheer them up!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Say hello to the new Mars astronaut- R2D2!!!!</h2>
  <p>You might be tinkering 
    around with that new Lego robot set on Xmas morning, but what you might 
    not know is that you might be doing the same thing as NASA on their 
    next Mars missions!!!!!! The "space dudes" are going to be using robots 
    to 'follow the water' on their next missions!!!!! Er, except of course, 
    that they're not using Lego, at least not last time I looked!!!!! Now 
    you might think that using a robot to 'follow the water' is a bit stupid 
    as the water will "fuse" it's "positronic brain" and put into a "logical 
    failure" or something like that... Well, this robot is a little different!!!! 
    Apparently this one has "eyes" and "ears"!!!!!! So it'll probably be 
    also wearing a nice waterproof macintosh jacket as well!!!</p>

  <h2>Car thieves: wear asbestos suits!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As that nice young man Jack Dee once said: car alarms are great- you can now hear when 
    someone's walking near your car!!!!!! Only now with this invention here, 
    you won't just hear an alarm!!!! You'll also hear a massive "foom!!!" 
    and agonised wailing cries of pain!!! No, it's not a car alarm in Baghdad 
    accidentelly mucking up one of those global missile postioning satellites!!!!! 
    In fact, it's a car alarm with built-in flamethrower!!!!!!!!! Apparently 
    the first customer is a policeman or something.</p>

  <h2>Rebel Yell- but not on MP3!!!</h2>
  <p>Those UK Teletext dudes are really on the ball aren't they?!?!?! On the day (18/11/98) 
    their C4 mag on p143 announces that Billy Idol is putting some new material 
    in MP3 form on <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a>, 
    Sir William of Idol decides to remove the two tracks he originally 
    submitted!!!! In this message on mp3.com's bbs, it is strongly implied 
    by the admin that Sir Cyberwilly of Idol's label might have been put 
    under a bit of pressure by the American record industry body (RIAA), 
    who at the moment, don't really like MP3!!!! Ah well, all it means is 
    that major labels will be waiting for ages for some proprietary format 
    to be worked out, whilst everyone else will still be using MP3s... Sounds 
    like they're really thinking ahead, huh?!?!?</p>

  <h2>A bit 'crotchet'-ty?!?!?! (DOH!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, it's not 
    just record industry types that are annoyed with tha infonet webway 
    highpipe!!!!! Music *<b>publishers</b>* are also a bit miffed, because 
    you can now download sheet music and print it out, without using them 
    as a middle-man!!!!!!!! They're probably "quaver"ing in their boots!!!!!!!!!
    (Nurse!!! My sides!!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Techno?!?!?! What's that?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Now this is quite 
    amusing!!!!! Whilst us lucky Europeans are listening to "What's She 
    Going To Look Like With a Chimney On Her" or something like that, apparently 
    this "techno" lark is new to Johnny Yankee!! <i>"The technology revolution 
    is fueling a cultural revolution whereby artists are creating new music, 
    be it in a recording studio or their bedroom."</i> says some US person, 
    which sounds a bit like something we might have said 10 years ago over 
    here in the UK!!!!!!! What's interesting about this story tho is that 
    fans of techno are apparently using the internet, MP3, online sales, 
    etc., ... So they might be a bit behind us like they were with punk, 
    but at least we won't have to wait too long until a techno equivalent 
    of Green Day comes along!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Operation Desert Fox: RTFM!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, now it's 
    the season to be waging war and so on, you'll no doubt be interested 
    in this old book that you can now get on tha megamighty w3!!!!! It's 
    called "The Art of War" and it's by some bloke called Sun Tzu, and amazingly 
    enough, it's on the very good <b>Newstrolls</b> (See <a href="18.html#542">

  <p>You know <b>Nike</b>- 
    the lot that are spelled "nike", but are pronounced "Nike, hey!!!"!??!?!?! 
    Did you get one of their shoes this Xmas!?!?!? Well, apparently, you 
    can now use it as a vacuum cleaner!!!! This is because apparently Nike 
    (hey!) really sucks!!!!! At least, so say this little site, the "Nike 
    Sucks" webring!!!! It's run by some person called "Punk Ska", so maybe 
    he's American or something.</p>

  <h2>Fox Mulder: Does he read this?!?!?</h2>
  <p>One thing that 
    always makes Xmas is comedy!!! Well, we think we've found the "Only 
    Fools & Horses" of the net for this Xmas!!!!! The ultimate wacky conspiracy 
    site, <b>The Konformist</b>, is even funnier tho, because they take 
    it incredibly seriously!!!!!! We've actually seen a serious examination 
    of the charge that the Spice Girls are part of a worldwide brain-washing 
    conspiracy!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Now that there's this "conflict" business with Iraq, the mailing 
    list is going overtime on it's conspiracy theories!!!!!! And it's 
    really hilarious!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Looks like there'll be an 'Insurrection' now!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, here's a 
    bit of a surprise!!!!! The ninth Star Trek film "Insurrection" has been 
    trashed in a review on Slashdot!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>However, a lot of people are also going on about some supposed "curse

    a load of bull, and as bad as Trek 5, wasn't it!??!?!</p>

  <h2>Er, OK then- don't stock up with food for 2000!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is a surprise!!!! It's a Y2K "controversy" story, and it doesn't come from 
    the US!!!!!!! In fact, it comes from the UK, so we don't have to hear 
    of loadsa stories about cranky people with weapons stocking up on food!!!!!! 
    Well, not right at the mo anyway, if this story is anything to go by!!!!! 
    Apparently some big Y2K dude in the government is denying that he advised 
    people to stock up on food... Erm, so what was talking about then?!?!?!? 
    There's not many things you can confuse with advice to stockpile food, 
    is there?!?!?!?!</p>

  <p>Now, from Y2K 
    to NTK!!!!! (That was a good link, wasn't it?!?!?) those lovely people 
    at <b>Need To Know</b> ezine-world, have decided to stop moaning about 
    the UK cryptography policy, and do something about it!!!!! They've set 
    up this little site where you can "adopt" an MP, and... then they're 
    going to something unspecified in the very near future with all these 
    "adoptions"!!!!!! Probably get us to add our names to an email, and 
    then send them all off at the same time, sending zillions of emails 
    to every MP, and probably giving the government email system a bit of 
    headache!!!!</p>
  <p>We think this is a very good idea, so we say take a trip along to 
    their site!!!!</p>

    anything completely!!!!!! But, er, they're the NSA, aren't they!?!?!? 
    They spy on everyone, and break loads of security and so on, so they 
    *<b>would</b>* say that you can't secure anything completely, wouldn't

    take some piddling little part of the place where they make the stuff, 
    and go on and on about it, like they're National Geographic or something!!!!!!!! 
    Well, after this week, maybe they should do an ad with some Linux proppelor-head 
    nerd geek young fellow on his compute, and write below it:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"THEY give <b>Billy-Ray Jim Bob</b> a special name around these parts: 
        they call him 'HackMaster of The Lethal Phreaker Crew'.</p> 
      <p>He's spent years 
        learning how to hack into any sort of system you can imagine. That's why 
        he's now hacking into the Jack Daniel's website.</p>
      <p>He may spend days on his 
        computer, but, as they say around town, 'insert trite proverb here'."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yes, that's right, someone hacked the Jack Daniels website!!!!</p>

    which is 4 mins long, and will appear at the start of next year!!!! 
    Oh flippy, that means another flippin' big download, only it'll be much

    was all that talk a couple of years ago about how Java was designed to 
    work in microwaves, telephones, toenail clippers, etc.. , but that quietened 
    down a bit... Until now!!!!!! Sun, the company wot makes Java, has got 
    together with Matsui, who make radiograms, amongst other things!!!!!!</p>
  <p>They're supposed to be working on consumer devices with Java proggys 
    in them!!! Which is really good, because it means in future, if I 
    want to switch on my telly, I just fire up Andrew Ridgley (The name 
    of my Wintel box!!! It used to be called James Dean- until someone 
    pointed out that James Dean only crashed once!!!!!!), log onto tha

    was what they do when they knock down the inside of a building, but 
    leave the outside still standing!!!</p>

  <h2>Web awards: yawn!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, apparently 
    there are too many web awards around, and so the "proper" ones aren't 
    getting taken seriously!!!!!! At least so say this lot who do a web 
    awards called the "<b>Webby</b>"!!!!!!!!!!! Erm, somehow I think the 
    real reason they're not being taken seriously is because they're called 
    the "Webby"!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    makes me at least 3 times as old as our American counterparts!!!! They 
    won't even have remembered "Bagpuss"!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Playstation Radiostation!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, our radio 
    station <b>Radio East Miton</b> (See <a href="18.html#541"> issue 18</a>...) 
    appears to be packing 'em in!!!!!!! (Well, we think so- actually, our 
    modem's not fast enough to be able to listen to it!!!!!!!) But here's 
    another station on tha W3- for the Playstation!!!!!!!!!! Yes, the Playstation 
    people have done an internetto webby thingy radio station for the Playstation, 
    and they've done some sort of joke thingy with it!!!! I'm presume it 
    was done in the style of David letterman's "Top Tens", because it's 
    not really that much funny at all!!!!</p>
    <pre class="usenet">"Top Ten reasons the PlayStation Underground Radio Network
      is better than radio:

      10. You can listen to it AND watch it.
       9. You can do # 10 while at the office and you'll actually look
          like you're working.
       8. Interviews you won't find anywhere else from the people who
          make your favorite PlayStation games.
       7. Hot, fresh codes hand delivered 24 hours a day for no extra
          charge.
       6. Short attention span? Mind wanders? No worries. You can go
          back and listen to what you missed again. And again. And
          again.
       5. No strange static when you drive under bridges.
       4. Your friends will NEVER come to your house just to listen
          to the radio.
       3. No Emergency Broadcast Service tests--ever.
       2. David Lawrence is your host, and if you can handle it, the
          guys from videogames.com are there to tell you first hand
          what it's all about.
       1. You'll never have to sit through a crummy pop song to find
          out what cool thing is coming up next." </pre>

  <h2>Just don't tell Chris Evans about this!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some scientest 
    people are apparently doing some jolly clever work in this story- they 
    appear to have given cloning a big push with their complex experiments!!!!! 
    That's interesting, as it means in future, I can clone myself before 
    I kick the bucket, and continue to annoy people throughout enternity!!!!!!! 
    What do you mean: "You're sounding like Davros now!!!"?!?!?!?</p>
