    <h1>Official!!! Furbies are security threats!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Woops!!!!!!! Sorry for that break in publication last week, but I
      was really busy on this presentation thingy!!!!!! You see, I got an
      interview for some job thingy at a university place, and it was for
      some job about learning using computers or some such lark!!!!!!!! So
      I had to do a presentation about learning on the Internet, and I
      spent a long time working on it!!!!!!!! Unfortunately, I think I came
      across as a little too forceful!!!!! After all there's only so many
      times you can say "Shut up and stop talking, you idiots!!!!" isn't there?!?!?</p>
    <p>Anyway, I've also been working hard on my brilliant editing suite for
      this publication, and I've now got the first version working!!!! And this is is the first issue edited on it!!!!!!!!! So,
      there should be less spelling mistakes from now on, as I can edit the stories in the databse a little easier now!!!! Even
      more interesting is that very soon, we'll have done 666 stories!!!!!!
      So hopefully we won't be taken over by the Devil before the next
      issue!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Windows 2001- on a toaster?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, you're used 
    to the speed and reliability that only Windows can provide, but are 
    you ready for it on your toaster!?!??!?! No, I'm not talking about a 
    CD-Writer here, silly!!!!! I'm talking about the thing you make toast 
    on!!!!!!!! Yes, that's right, MS wants a "Start" button on your home 
    electrical appliances, with the introduction of their Universial Plug 
    'n' Play initiative!!!!!!! I just hope that my bread doesn't cause a 
    general protection fault on an MS Toaster tho!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>'Yepp', we can play MP3!!!!!!!!! (Doh!!!!)</h2>
  <p>You might be wondering if the Diamond Rio is going to have any competition in the MP3 player 
    market... To this we can only say: "Yepp!!!!!!!!" That's because *<b>Yepp</b>* 
    is the name of a new range of MP3 players by big Korean dudes, Samsung, 
    which was shown off this week at the International CES held in Las Vegas!!!! 
    What's really interesting about it is that in amongst the range is the 
    first ever consumer MP3 *<b>recorder</b>* we've seen!!!!!! Shame Elvis 
    isn't still around, or they could have have got him to sing "Viva Las 
    Vegas" into it, and it could be released as an MP3 on tha netweb!!!!!!!! 
    That would certainly be good promotion, wouldn't it!!!!!!!!! It's just 
    a shame Elvis kicked the bucket over 20 years ago!!!!!!!! Bet Samsung 
    are kicking themselves!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Aha Mr Furby, I've been expecting you!!!!!</h2>
  <p>But one place an MP3 recorder <i>wouldn't</i> be welcome is in a building run by the 
    American National Security Agency!!!! (NSA) They ban all recording thingies 
    in case it's a Russian spy taping secrets about the hydrogen bomb or 
    something!!!!!!!!! So guess what they did with Furbies, which can record 
    sounds and replay them?!?!?! Yep, that's right, they've banned them 
    as well!!!!! So what you may think, but the media have went absoltuely 
    crazy about the flippin' thing!!!!!!!! CNN even give us a helpful description 
    in case we want to report them to the authorities!!!!! <i>"Furby resembles 
    an owl, with tufts of hair between its huge pink ears."!!!!!!!</i> One 
    wonders if the NSA are doing this to appear "hip" and "crazy" and not 
    at all like an ominous massively secretive "Big Brother" type grouping!!!!!!! 
    I wonder if the Konformist mailing list (See <a href="20.html#592"> 
    issue 20</a>...) is going to go on about this?!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Installing a printer: the ballet!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I bet you'd think 
    that installing a printer on your compute was really boring!!!!! Well, 
    you'd be wrong!!!!!! This lot have made a flippin' ballet out of it!!!!!!! 
    Check out this exciting webpage called <i>"Installing a network PostScript 
    printer on a Sun workstation running SunOS, as illustrated through interpretive 
    dance."</i> So, not only are these dudes educating you about networks 
    and printers, they're also expanding your artistic horizons!!!!!!!! 
    We really think the third piccy is pretty neat!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Public Enemy- in MP4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, these guys certainly know how to "Fight the Power"!!!!! Only a month or two after 
    they posted their entire "Bring the Noise 2000" album online in MP3 
    format just to annoy their record company, and then took it off after 
    their record company got annoyed enough to get heavy with the lawyer 
    people, they've now posted a new song, "Swindlers Lust"- in *<b>MP4</b>* 
    format!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html">http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html</a></p>
  <p>But what's MP4!?!?! Is it the latest form of MPEG file?!?!?! In 
    fact, no it isn't!!!!! It's just some company's proprietary format 
    which they just happen to call "MP4", which by an odd coincidence 
    just happens to sound exactly like what you would expect to call an 
    MPEG-1 Layer 4 file, or an MPEG-4 file!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html</a></p>
  <p>But that's not all!!!!!!!!!! A lot of people on Slashdot have noticed 
    that PE's tune only available as Windows only executable file and 
    are kicking up a bit of a fuss about it!!!!!!!! The executable apparently 
    includes a player, but it's ironic that PE are slagging off commercialism 
    in such a prinicipled fashion, whilst supporting the world's biggest 
    software company and using a proprietary format!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml</a></p>
  <p>But the player wasn't the only executable!!!!!!!! At the time of 
    writing (11/1/99), the website posted this warning:</p>
  <blockquote>
    If you downloaded Swindler's Lust MP4 today (1/7) between 3 p.m.and 
    5:15 p.m. EST, it may be infected with a virus. A new copy has been 
    uploaded. P.E. apologizes for the oversight.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Woops!!!!!! Luckily, some compiled an MP3 version of the file!!!!!!!! 
    And the Public Enemy website people have also put it on their website, 
    which now means PE are now supporting a cross-platform non-proprietary 
    format!!!!!!! So it's ended up all right in the end anyway!!!!!!!

  <h2>Type- with your brain!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Aren't there some 
    times when you've wanted to bash your head on the keyboard!?!?!? I know 
    it's happened to me!!!! And the odd thing is- most people don't notice 
    the difference in the articles when I do it!!!!!!!! But in future, you 
    might be doing the same thing too- if you're not doing it already!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    That's because this clever bunch of people are starting to work out 
    how to control computers- by the power of the mind!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>All I can say is, I hope they have a "Mindpower Input Level" knob 
    on this thing, for people, such as myself, who have exceptionally 
    powerful minds!!!!!! I wouldn't want to accidentely blow up my computer 
    with my mind!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>We can't wait for 'RoncoRock' now!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, we've been listening to some of the various unsigned bands on tha netweb, and we've 
    come up with a real corker here!!!!!!!!! Ladies and gentlemen, let us 
    present ... (Drum role!!!!) <b>KTelFunk</b>!!! Isn't that the best band 
    name ever!!!!!!!!! We certainly think so!!!! And their "KTelFunk Theme 
    Song" is really great- it sounds like Fleetwood Mac circa 1971 jamming 
    with 808-State circa 1992- in a school assembly hall!!!!!!! Why don't 
    more people think of such great ideas as this!!!!!!! Their influences 
    are: <i>"Boston, Van Halen, Milli Vanilli, George Michael, Paganini, 
    Django Reinhardt"</i>...</p>

  <h2>Californian software engineers... take drugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you know about us and drugs!!!!!!!! The only time we use "hash" is during FTP 
    transfers!!!!!! By which we are of course referring to the use of the 
    command "hash" in an FTP session in order to toggle the display of "#" 
    characters per block of FTP transfer!!!!!!!!!!! But this lot are different!!!!! 
    Delegates at some conference called <b>"Digital Be-In"</b> are wishing 
    to acknowledge the importance of drug-taking in the computing industry!!!!! 
    <i>I feel good about who I am, and I wouldn't be who I am without LSD!"</i> 
    said one person.</p>
  <p>So... Apparently a lot of the software and hardware we're used to 
    today was written by people on drugs!!!!!!!! And this is supposed 
    to be news to us!?!?!?!?!??!

  <h2>Raytrace... in time!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever travelled near the speed of light and thought: <i>"This sort of thing 
    isn't representated very well by modern raytracing programs!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?!?!!? 
    Well, if so, you'll like this new raytracer!!!!! <b>Backlight</b> raytraces 
    using the laws of Relativity to measure the effect on light, which affects 
    the final picture!!!!!!!! So, if Einstien wanted to use a raytracer, 
    he might use this one!!!!!!!!!!! So, it's a bit of shame that he's dead 
    now, isn't it?!??!?!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Charles Bronson- on tha NetWeb!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>According to this article, you'd need to have a bit of a "Deathwish" to hack on tha inphopipeway 
    today!!!!!! Apparently there's a lot of "cyber vigilantes" that are 
    annoyed enough with hacker's exploits, that they go and do the same 
    things some naughty hackers do!!!!! Except that they're supposed to 
    be on the side of the law!!!!!!!! Which is a tad hyprocritical if you 
    ask me!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Mind you, some of these people seem to be as dim as a post, and 
    as subtle as a Michael Winner movie!!! One person who calls himself 
    "Lou Cipher" says: <i>"We have actually gotten on a plane and visited 
    the physical location where the attacks began. We've broken in, stolen 
    the computers and left a note: 'See how it feels?' "</i> Yep, sounds 
    a very cost effective and legally watertight method to us!!!!!! Now 
    we know what to do if some Norwegian hacks our site!!!!!!!! We'll 
    just get on the plane to Norway, break into a complete strangers office, 
    and steal their computers!!!!! If anything goes wrong and we get caught, 
    we'll just explain to the Norwegian authorities that it was all Louie 
    Ciphers' idea really!!!!! I'm sure they'll understand, even tho they'll 
    probably have trouble finding "Lou Cipher", because that's actually 
    a pseudonym he's adopted for some strange reason!!!!!!</p>
  <p>But it gets better!!!! Mr Cipher says that one time <i>"We had to 
    resort to baseball bats. That's what these punks will understand. 
    Then word gets around, and we're left alone. That's all we want, to 
    be left alone."</i> Which of course explains why all the loners we 
    know of carry baseball bats, doesn't it?!?!??!! Some of you older 
    readers might remember that this story sounds oddly familiar- in fact 
    we covered a similar online-inspired baseball bat showdown in our 
    very first issue!!!!! (See <a href="1.html#4"> issue 1</a>...) OK, 
    it wasn't about hacking, but then again, everyone knows that all hackers 
    deserve to get beaten around the head with baseball bats, don't they?!?! 
    Mind you, it wouldn't be so good for the computer security industry, 
    which is stuffed with ex-hackers, and is, oddly enough, Lou Cipher's 
    line of work...</p>
  <p><a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/12/cybervigilantes.idg/">http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/12/cybervigilantes.idg/</a></p>

    funny!!!!!! <b>Hacker News Network (HNN)</b> says it's a load of FUD 
    rubbish!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Like Ben the Boffin, only Irish!!!! (And female!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, we've mentioned in the past about the Republic of Ireland apparently set to become a 
    major centre of e-commerce, (See <a href="17.html#520"> issue 17</a>...) 
    but what do you need for secure e-commerce!?!??! That's right, a decent 
    encryption algorithm!!!!! So luckily for the republic, some really smart 
    16 year old girl has invented some spiffy new type of encryption called 
    <b>Cayley-Purser</b> encryption!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254236.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_254000/254236.stm</a></p>
  <p>Mind you, the Slashdot people are a little cynical!!!! I wonder 
    why!!!! Perhaps it's because the story looks a little similar to another 
    "young boffin invents spiffy encryption technique" type story from 
    the BBC News website!!!!!! (See <a href="6.html#169"> issue 6</a>...)</p>

  <h2>April Fool: Your clock's slow!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>What will you be doing on April 1, 2001?!?!?! Will you be trading jolly japes en route 
    to a big space station whilst playing "The Blue Danube" on an MP3 walkman!?!?!?! 
    Or maybe you'll be on a ship going to Jupiter, and playing April Fool 
    jokes on a really intelligent computer, who will later kill you dead!!!!!!! 
    But according to this article, what you'll actually be doing on April 
    1 2001 is fixing the clock on your Wintel box, if you have one!!!!! 
    That's because the fact that April 1 on 2001 falls on a Saturday confuses 
    one of the DLL files in Windows, and it forgets about putting the clocks 
    forward on that day, and only sets things right a week later!!!!!</p>

    talking about the synthetic form of one of the fundamental building 
    blocks of life!!!!!! And these clever dudes have made a tiny little 
    robot "arm" from it, and expect this to be the practical base from which 
    to start on nanomachines!!!!!!!! Bet when you last looked at your DNA, 
    you never thought that you'd be seeing the basis of a very small version

  <p>As you might have heard recently, (See <a href="20.html#602"> issue 20</a>...) some clever 
    boffins are working towards the first "photon" chip!!!!! But it's a 
    hard job getting all the bits of optical plastic together... Wouldn't 
    it be really cool if the plastic could put itself together, all by itself!??!!? 
    Well, that's what these clever people are working on!!!!!!!! No, they're 
    not plastic molecules themselves, silly!!!!!! They're telling the plastic 
    molecules how to put themselves together, and they do it, just like

    This one called "<b>picture.exe</b>" which apparently displays a picture 
    or something!!!!!!!!!! But it's really a trojan horse!!!!! What it does 
    is it scans for email address on your hard-drive, and then makes up 
    a list of email addrs from all the data, and posts them to a couple 
    email addrs in China!!!!!!! Why, we don't know- and no-one else knows 
    either!!!!! Exciting, huh?!?!?!?</p>

  <h2>Get down, Pluto!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I bet when you saw all those cartoons of Pluto when you were young, that you didn't 
    think "Astronomers will be arguing if he's a planet in the future!!!!!" 
    But that's what's happened!!!!!!! Of course, they aren't really talking 
    about the famous Disney cartoon character!!!!!! They're actually talking 
    about a flying piece of rock that was named after the dog by an American 
    astronomer called Clyde Tombaugh!!!!! (Who ironically, was himself named 
    after a famous paddle steamer on the River Clyde which went to the Mull 
    of Kintyre, which is where Paul McCartney got the idea for his song!!!!!!!! 
    So if you ever wanted to know what the connection is between Paul McCartney 
    and a piece of flying rock millions of miles away, now you know!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
    Erm, anyway!!!! When it was discovered, it was thought Pluto was the 
    ninth planet in the Solar System, but it looked a bit small for a planet!!!!!!! 
    Then, astronomers found an area not so far way called the "<b>Kuiper 
    Belt</b>", (Named of course after Agent Cooper in "Twin Peaks"!!!!) 
    which has around 60 Pluto-sized asteroids!!!!! So it looks as though 
    Pluto is really just a big asteroid originating from that area, and 
    is not really a planet at all!!!!! (Which astronomers always expected 
    to be a bit more massive than Pluto appeared to be- because of gravity 
    or something really smart like that!!!!!)</p>

    waste of your time reading that, wasn't it?!?!?! Which of course, was 
    exactly my point in the first place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
  <p>Anyway, here's one way in which people waste their time!!!!!!! This 
    is a website called "<b>Disgustocollective</b>"- which is against

    very quickly!!!!!! Well, you might ask, what is in the game!?!?!?! Well, 
    in this case, it's the pilot episode of that popular TV show "<b>South 
    Park</b>"!!!!!!!! Yep, someone decided to put a copy of the original 
    South Park story "<b>The Spirit of Christmas</b>" on the CD-Rom of one 
    of EA's games without telling anyone!!!!!!! If you've got the early

  <h2>Get some money from Microsoft- for a 'publicity stunt'!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You now, sometimes news is like a snowball!!!!!!! An obvious example of this happened this 
    week, when someone put up a web page of his experiences in trying to 
    get money from Microsoft!!!!! He'd bought a little PC computer, and 
    they had pre-loaded Windows on it... But he didn't want the PC for Windows, 
    as he was going to put Linux on it!!!!!!!!! So he asked for a refund 
    on the software!!!!! Apparently that microscopic text with that licence 
    thingy you get with Windows says that you can get a refund!!!!!!!! He 
    had a bit of trouble actually getting the money from them tho!!!!! But 
    when he eventually got it, he detailed all his experiences on a webpage 
    for all to read!!!!!</p>

  <p>Then someone told Slashdot about it!!!!!!!! And there was a lot of discussion!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/18/1539214.shtml">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/18/1539214.shtml</a></p>
  <p>The resulting publicity inspired this interesting little website 
    which is organising a mass "refund" day!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Hey!!! Let's build a spaceship!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, there's nothing like forward planning!!!!!!!!!! And some dude called 
    <b>Steven Kilston</b> who's involved with NASA in some way, really knows 
    it!!!!!!!!!!! He's designing a superduper fabby-dabby spaceship- and 
    it'll only be completed (If ever!!!!) a very long time from now, when 
    you're dead!!!!!!!! And the mission is so long that when it's finished, 
    the people who will first pilot the ship will be dead as well!!!!!!!! 
    Apparently it's a "generational" spaceship or something.</p>

  <h2>They're watching you- in the office!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, one jolly interesting thing about Britain is that apparently we don't yet have 
    anything about human rights in our constitution!!!!!!!!! So we can get 
    these jolly little stories about people spying on each other in the 
    office!!!!!!! Apparently, your boss could be watching you as you download 
    porn from the internet!!!! Why he doesn't just download it himself is 
    anyone's guess!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Antifreeze- for plants!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>When you're wanting to protect the plants in your garden against the harsh temperatures 
    of winter, what do you do?!?!?! Well, you might spray your plants with 
    anti-freeze like I do!!!!!!! Unfortunately you might find that the disadavantages 
    (Most of your plants drop dead!!!!!) outweigh the advantages!!!!! (Your 
    home-made tomato juice tastes very much like Austrian red wine!!!!!) 
    Well, it appears in future, we won't need to worry about that!!!!! We'll 
    just need to put jeans on the plants!!!! Well... Not really, but can 
    put special *<b>genes</b>* on them!!!!!!!!! Some really clever scientests 
    have found the gene which prevents plants freezing!!!!!! Which is really 
    interesting, because if I run out of antifreeze when I'm trying to get 
    my Robin Reliant defrosted, I can grow these special plants, and rub 
    them on the car instead!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Have  a TV dinner- in a restaurant!!!!!</h2>
  <p>When I saw the headline "<b>Why Hooters Carries DirecTV</b>" in this interesting little 
    article, I thought that these "Hooters" must be really big then!!!!!! 
    But it was all a misunderstanding!!!!!!! In fact, it's to do with a 
    restaurant chain that have a TV system with 500 channels!!!!!!!! So 
    now you can pick Playboy TV, and see hooters- in Hooters!!!!!!!!!!</p>
