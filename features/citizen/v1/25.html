    <h1>Playstation 2: Yawn!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>This is a bit of a strange 
      issue, because it looks like our web server on <b>Grelb</b> really <i>is</i> 
      shutting down now, after that false alarm stuff last year!!!!!! (See <a href="9.html"> 
      issue 9</a>...) They're supposed to be shutting down on <b>Fri 5 March</b> 
      and moving to a new server at <a href="http://grelb.wasters.com/">http://grelb.wasters.com/</a> 
      , but I don't know if they've done that yet, at the time of writing!!!!!!!!! 
      One thing will be sure, all you lucky email list people will probably be 
      getting this issue first!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Big Brother Inside II: It Wasn't Really Switched Off!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have vaguely remembered that little privacy argument over Pentium IIs 
      and their serial numbers!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="23.html#676"> issue 
      23</a>...) Intel said it could be switched "off" by one of their clever 
      programs, but as the number is still there, it would only take someone 
      to work out how to switch it back "on" again!!!!!!!! And that "person" 
      is the old German computer mag, <b>C'T'</b>!!!!!!!! They've now proved 
      that even with the number switched "off", software can still switch 
      it back on and read it!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Intel are now doing a "fix", wherw the BIOS makes sure the number 
    is kept "off", but firstly that only works at bootup, so some company 
    could still read your serial no. in the meantime!!!!!! And what's 
    more, your BIOS can also be re-programmed to not switch the number 
    off!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Wired gets wired- to MP3!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>For some unexplained reason, it's unofficial "MP3 Week" in Wired!!!!!!!!! 
    After all the usual hysteria along the lines of "MP3=piracy" or whatever, 
    they've done a whole load of stories about people doing good things with 
    the file format!!!!!!!!! They've of course mentioned the very nice people 
    at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a> who let loads of people upload their tunes to their servers, and then make CDs of them!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Like the 'Brits'- only the music's really good!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have been riveted by <b>Belle & Sebastian</b> winning a gong,
    or <b>Bjorn Ulvaeus</b> putting on a brave face after the worst pop bands in
    Britain made a complete pigs ear of his songs, but here's an awards
    ceremony that is probably a little less like a music industry piss-up!!!!!!
    And it's all thanks to MP3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yep, it's the <b>MP3
    Music Awards</b>!!!!!!! So if you have a groovy tune, MP3 it and put
    it on tha NetWeb, then give this lot the URL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I still
    dunno why all their webpages are big single images with text and
    everything tho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Operating System- for Lego!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I bet when you 
    were doing all those funny shapes in Lego (And then actually building 
    something with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) when you were young, that you weren't 
    thinking: <i>"Hmmm... Wouldn't it be really great if I could write an 
    operating system for this!??!?!?!"</i> Well, OK, you might have done, 
    but if did, you're a bit slow!!!!!!! Because it's only now that someone 
    has done has actually done it!!!!!!! Yes, it's a special Linux program 
    for people who wish to connect their computes to that funny <b>Mindstorms</b> 
    range of bricks that those tight-fisted peeps in Lego-land didn't send 
    us a beta test copy of!!!!!!! (See <a href="2.html#45"> issue 2</a>...) 
    BTW it's called... <b>LegOS</b>!!!!!!!! I hope it doesn't get confused 
    with any operating systems for artificial legs!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Speed of light slowed down a bit!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wanted to go on a bicycle and cycle faster than the speed of 
    light!?!?!?!?!?!? Don't woryy, you won't need Sir Clive Sinclair to make you 
    a powered "zike" which has infinite energy!!!!!!!!!!!!! You just need these 
    people in the following article to slow down the apparent speed of light for 
    you!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Well, actually, they of course do not actually slow down the speed of light, 
    as that's always at the.. erm, speed of light!!!!!!!! They actually stick the 
    light through a cloud of atoms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the effect of sticking 
    loadsa atoms in the way slows down the transmission of light to a puny 17 metres 
    a second!!!!!!!!!  Why not just stick a brick wall in front of the light beams-
    that would slow it down to zero metres per second, wouldn't it?!?!?!?!?!?

  <h2>They'll certainly 'shout' about this!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever been surfing on tha NetWeb, and thought: <i>"Hmmm... It's a shame I 
    don't have a Wurlitzer with me!!!!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!</i> Well, now someone 
    has solved that somewhat awkward predicament!!!!!!!!! If you've got 
    a speedy gonzales netweb connection and the latest version of Winamp, 
    that is!!!!!!!! Yes, that's right, it's one of those delightful <b>Shoutcast</b> 
    broadcasting sites, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</a>...) and 
    this one's a jukebox style one!!!!!!!! This one allows one to browse 
    through a list of tunes, and select from them which ones you want to 
    be queued on the server next!!!!!!!!! And there's actually quite a good 
    choice!!!!!!!!! Despite the really dreary choice that passes for "random" 
    choices when no-one's requesting anything, (You would probably like 
    it if you read that "Rolling Stone" magazine a lot!!!!) there's actually 
    a slightly better choice than you get in most pub jukeboxes!!!! So when 
    we found about this really neat site, the first thing we did we did 
    was to stop all the Counting Crows and similar nonsense and queue up 
    some good old Aqua and Duran Duran, which must have been a bit disconcerting 
    to the other two listeners at the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>It's probably a bit dodgy on the legal front to say the least, what with all those
    copyright files being streamed outwards, but we like the
    idea, and can imagine a legit equivalent of it going down
    really well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So you might as well get along to it before
    someone goes el-stamp-o on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Microsoft: can we buy linux.com please?!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Shortly after 
    we told you about Microsoft patenting stylesheets, (See <a href="24.html#694"> 
    issue 24</a>...) we heard of this mind-boggling story of MS wanting 
    to buy into the Linux market!!!!!!!!!!!!! A couple of years ago, some 
    guy brought the domain name <b>linux.com</b>, and he's now selling it!!!!!!! 
    And guess who was one of the bidders!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,33186,00.html">http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,33186,00.html</a></p>
  <p>This might be a surprise to some people who read a completely different
    story from another MS spokesperson the very next day!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
    according to this person Linux has a 'weak value proposition'- which no doubt
    explains why MS were wanting to buy into it, doesn't it?!?!?!?!?!?!

  <h2>Co-pilots: for cars!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever  driven a car, crashed it, and then subsequently thought: <i>"Wouldn't 
    it be a great idea if I was ever in that precarious situation again, 
    that a disembodied presence would take over from me and drive to safety!?!?!?!"?!?</i> 
    Well, some clever people are working on it!!! However, unlike co-pilots 
    in airlines, this co-pilot won't have to keep fiddling with his joystick!!!!!!! 
    That's because it's actually a computer which can control the steering 
    and speed, and take over at the first sign of danger!!!!!!!!!! So you'll 
    probably always find yourself slowing down behind Skodas!!!!!!!!! And 
    the really funny thing is, it's by the <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>, 
    those nice people who patent their MP3 encoding algorhythms!!!!!!!!!! 
    (See <a href="11.html#328"> issue 11</a>...) You'll probably need to 
    install one of those funny new MP3 players in your car to get this thing 
    to work!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>This 'art' is complete guesswork- literally!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you seen one of those "modern art" thingies (Like "Cow Pat Cut In Half" by
    Damien Hirst or whatever it is!!!!!!!!!) and thought <i>"I can do that shit,
    completely at random!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?!?! Well, you'd be right, because here's a
    site dedicated to creating art that's as modern as you can get, and it does it
    completely at random!!!!!!! No, it's not one of those "fractal" places!!!!!!! Erm...
    well, actually, it's a bit like that, really!!!!!!! It's the <b>Gallery of Random
    Art</b>!!!!!!! It generates funny little pictures randomly using the almighty
    power of mathematics!!!!!!!!! And you can vote on the best and worst of them, and
    the best are kept for posterity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>New York Times- in MP3!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you've ever 
    been to one of those <b>Newstrolls</b> (See <a href="6.html#192"> issue 
    6</a>...) links, you might know exactly why the <b>New York Times</b> 
    website is so bloody irritating!!!!! yes, that's right, it's one of 
    those sites where you have to "register" with them before you can view 
    any of their news stories!!!!!!!! Even worse, they do it really well, 
    so it's not like the UK <b>Times</b> website where a user's registration 
    number is part of the URL, giving you a URL that you <i>can</i> read 
    a story from without registering, and then navigate through the rest 
    of the "restricted" site!!!!!!!! Well, here's one way you can get by 
    the NY Times' barriers!!!!!!!!!! The paper now does a news summary in 
    MP3 format from mp3.com!!!!!! But evn then, the NYT lot are still being 
    bloody irritating- there's no RealAudio "Instant Play" function, so 
    you have to download a flippin' meg and a half of MP3 before you can 
    listen to and decide if it's worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>A phone processor?!?!?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Have you ever been on the phone to someone really boring who talked a lot, and while they were going on and on, you
    were thinking: <i>"I could have whisked an egg in the time it takes this idiot takes to say
      something!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>?!?!?! Well, now you do can this!!!!!!!! With a handy new "Ronco" style appliance called
    the "<b>BlenderPhone</b>"!!!!!!!!!! It's erm, a phone with a blender on it!!!!!!! This miracle device will appear on
    the "Howie Mandell" show!!!!!!!!!!! I dunno what that is, but it sounds impressive!!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, I can't wait
    for those clever people to come up with the "HooverShaver"!!!!!!!!!! Funnily enough, a lot of people think I already
    have a HooverShaver, but that's only because my current electric shaver is so
    old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Radio East Milton- a division of MTV Networks!!!!</h2>
  <p>We'll probably need to get orange oblong "media" glasses and adopt an "ironic" grin 
    now!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently MTV bought our radio station <b>Radio East 
    Milton</b> (See <a href="18.html#541"> issue 18</a>...) last week, and 
    we didn't notice!!!!!!!!! That's because they've bought over the company 
    <b>Imagine Radio</b> who do our internet radio station!!!!!!!! Apparently 
    this buyout is part of MTV's "Buggles Project", which is a bit ironic 
    as the song The Buggles are most famous for is <i>"Video Killed the 
    Radio Star"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Bags of fun- literally!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever lost your baggage in transit?!?!??!?!?! Well, someone in Swindom
    might buy it, thanks to the megamighty power of tha InphoPipeway
    NetWeb!!!!!!!!!!!! And it's all thanks to this wonderful <b>Unclaimed
    Baggage</b> website!!!!!!! Apparently they buy all this unclaimed baggage
    stuff, which is apparently at really cheap prices!!!!!!!!! Then they sell it
    on this website for only slightly more expensive prices!!!!!!!!!!!!! So it's it
    bit like the webby equivalent of Delboy!!!!!!!! Though obviously the unclaimed
    baggage hasn't fallen off any lorries or anything like that!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>M&Ms: in pastel colours!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is an intresting idea from the lot who do those sweetie
    thingies called <b>M&Ms</b>!!!!!!!! You can order M&Ms from their website- in
    custom colours!!!!!!!!!!!! So, if you've ever thought it would be a really
    good idea to get M&Ms in "cyan" and "teal green", now's your chance!!!!!!!!
    Only one problem tho... You can only order a minium of 40 pounds worth!!!!!!!!
    That might not sound too much, but this is not a UK website, it's an
    American one!!!!!!!!! And when they say 40 pounds, they actually mean 40
    pounds- in weight!!!!!!! Which ends up more expensive than one of those
    flippin' Diamond Rio MP3 players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Digitial film- it's too good!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have been to the cinema to watch a film, and in the middle of the film, some
    person in the audience stands up and shouts: <i>"This film's too
    good!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!?!?!?!?</i> Well, it doesn't happen at our Milton Gaumont
    cinema, I can tell you!!!!!!!! In fact, it's usually the opposite!!!!!!!!! Erm,
    anyway!!!! If these people in this article are to be believed, in future,
    we'll be complaining about the film looking too good!!!!!!!!!! (I don't see it
    myself somehow!!!!!!!!!!) This is because films are now starting to
    made using digital "film" instead of the usual celloid stuff!!!!!!! And
    already some filmakers are complaining that digital film is too good!!!!!!!!!
    Apparently, it's much more sharp and detailed than celluloid, and apparently
    it doesn't have the "character" of old film, or something vague like
    that!!!!!!! Someone in this article says:</p> 
  <blockquote>"If you go into a lamp shop today you'll still find a fair amount of lamps that are still pretending
    like they're candlesticks. But there's no reason an electric light should look
    like a candlestick."!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</blockquote>
  <p>Erm, well.. Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>You can see right through this one!!!!!!!!!! (DOH!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>    In an episode I saw recently of that jolly "tech" series "<b>Bugs</b>", some
    young teenage "hacker" person hid an ancient Mayan mask inside a loudspeaker
    on display in Dixons!!!!!! Well, in future that might not be a good idea, for
    two reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <Li>The loudspeakers wouldn't have any insides!!!!!!!!!
    <Li>Even if you put the mask inside the loudspeaker, you would still be able to see it!!!!!!!!!
  </ol>
  <p>That's some really clever people have invented transparent speakers that can be 
              stuck on glass or plexiglass!!!!!!!!! So in future you'll go to concerts, 
              and the speaker columns will look like an office block!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Cobblers: hacking British satellite!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Apparently there was some news story last week where some hackers logged onto
    a UK military satellite and wrote "Kilroy woz ere!!!!" or something like
    that!!!! Well, it's a load of cobblers, apparently!!!!!!!!!! 
    At least, so say
    the MOD, who finally bothered to comment on the story on 3rd March after
    loadsa days of "no comment"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The odd thing is that nearly all
    the UK media also went all "no comment" on the story, which first appeared in
    the UK edition of Yahoo News about a week ago, and reported nowhere else in
    the UK media, until this BBC report, quoting the MOD saying it's
    a load of cobblers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Here's the Yahoo story!!!!!!!!!!!
  <p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ts/story.html?s=v/nm/19990228/ts/hackers_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ts/story.html?<br/>
                s=v/nm/19990228/ts/hackers_1.html</a> </p>
  <p>And here's the BBC one where the MOD says it's a load of cobblers!!!!!!!!!
  <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_288000/288965.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_288000/288965.stm</a></p>
  <p>Well, that might not be worth reporting, you'd think!!!!!!!!!!! After all, the
    MOD would probably say it's a load of cobblers, wouldn't they, even if it
    wasn't!!!!!!!!!! But some people at a US mag on tha NetWeb, noticing the lack
    of UK investigation, decided to conduct their own!!!!!!!!!!! And they found
    out it was a load of cobblers as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But it's not really well
    publicised!!!!!!!!!! So we'll probably get tons of conspiracy theories
    coming out about this story for years to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Now this is a top site in our humble opinion!!!!!!!!!!! The Bad B-Movies site contains reviews of really brilliant movies like "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "The Evil Dead II"!!!!!!!!!!!

  <p>Well, this is a new angle on "Net=bad" type stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently,
    according to this story, some Italian guy surfed the net for <b>three WHOLE
    DAYS</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And at the end of that mammoth surf, he ended up
    suffering from hallucinations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>We expect there will now be tons of articles about people getting
    hallucinations from surfing the net, and someone will probably get round to
    making some really bad puns vis a vis "virtual reality" or something like
    that!!!!!! The funny thing is that I saw this telly documentary on sleep some
    time ago, and apparently there was experiments on sleep deprivation, and they
    found that people who didn't sleep got hallucinations!!!!!!!!! So what's this
    story got to do with tha NetWeb then?!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
