    <h1>Buy Sky Digital, or your telly will jump off a cliff!!!</h1>
    <p>This is the second time I've 
      written an editorial for this newsletter, and I've not had any idea of what 
      to put in the editorial!!!!! I mean, there's nothing happening on the "Grelb 
      move" front and the custom mailing list proggy is not ready yet, so tehre's 
      nothing else I can think of yet!!!!!! Argh!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>OK then, I have thought of something... By the end of 1998, I'll be wanting
      to do some sort of review of the year (Alright then, half year!!!!!!) so start
      thinking of your favourite stories so far, and I'll be asking you readers
      (especially you bunch in the mailing list!!!!) in a month or two to name your
      fave rave!!!!! (OK, fave story then!!!!!!!) So start looking!!!!</p>

  <h2>Be really cynical!!!</h2>
  <p>Yeah man, I'm like really cyncial because everything's crap and "the man"
    controls everything, and erm anyway!!! I'm pretending to be a really
    cynical person, but to be honest I'm a bit too cynical about it!!!!!!!!! (!!!)
    But if you like that sort of thing, here's a really spiffy website to help
    you!!!! Of course, I won't recommend it myself becuase I'm really cynical,
    but if you're a robot sheep vegetable fachist (Or whatever the Manic Street
    Preacher fans call them these days!!!!) who does what "the man" tells you
    to do, then you'll probably find it really great!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Netly News gets netted and nutted!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now this is really annoying!!!!! One of the more interesting web columns
    <b>The Netly News</b> has been shut down and replaced with some more "entertainment-based"
    tripe!!! First Hotwired (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...) ,
    and now this!!!! The way things are going, it'll only be us "geeky"
    types ( eg us, Slashdot, NTK) that'll be actually reporting the *<b>real</b>*
    spiffy webnews and commentary!!!</p>

  <h2>Vritual 'Doing it' can help real 'doing it'?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>As you might know from <b>"Killer Net"</b>, you can get pictures of people
    "actually doing it"!!!!! In fact, according to <b>.net</b> magazine's
    completely made-up statistic quoted in the prog 95% of the people in the
    Internet are "doing it"!!!!!! (By which of course we mean searching for
    pictures of people "doing it", not actually "doing it" themselves!!!!!) But
    it turns out that those 95% might be better at actually "doing it" for
    real!!!! This is because, as someone said, "doing it" for real gets better
    with practice, and what better way of practising than "doing it" in virtual
    reality!??!?! Actually, I'm not sure this is a good idea!!!!! I saw some
    "late-night" movie on Sky on this subject recently, and there was this
    "cyberpunk" type dude who kept saying things like "Holy gigabyte!!!!!" This
    is not the sort of thing I'd like to see encouraged in young people!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Un-dress in style!!!! (Fnarr fnarr!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, you can already "do it" in a virtual stylee- and you don't even need
    a computer!!!!! You can wear this wonderful thing called a <b>"Nude suit"</b>!!!
    It's basically one of those PVC thingies, like those "dolls", except that
    you can step inside it and wear it!!!!! So you can put on clothes in order
    to go to a fancy dress party as a nude person!!!!!!!!! You might get stopped
    by the police a few times tho...</p>

  <h2>Teddy Ruxpin mk2!!!</h2>
  <p>Some of you might have noticed that dreadful purple abomination Barney the
    Dinosaur appearing in Dixons!!!!!! If you're old enough you might remember
    an even earlier example of evil robotic schmaltz-dispensing fluffy toys-
    Teddy Ruxpin!!!!!! Well, the makers of that thingy have come up with an
    even more nightmarish prospect!!!!! And it's got an even sillier name!!!!!
    It's called "<b>Furby</b>"!!!!!!!!!!! It's apparently got a really big
    vocabulary!!!! But only half of it in English!!!!! The other half of it
    is in the "thing's" own language, called <b>Furbish</b>, which it
    talks initially, and then slowly adds in the English phrases!!!! So now
    you're going to get a lot of kiddies talking in Furbish!!!!!!! It's
    irresponsible!!!!!! Ban it, I say!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Installing Linux can be fun!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As Cliff Richard said in those 60s movies, <i>"Hey!!!!!!!!! Let's have a
    party!!!!!"</i> Only, instead of singing funny songs and dancing badly next
    to Una Stubbs, this lot in France are having a party on 10 October
    whilst installing Linux on their machines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And not just any
    old Linux either!!!!! It's apparently <i>"Linux comme Gimp, KDE, Gnome,
    Enlightenment, Wine, StarOffice,...."</i>, whatever that means!!!!! There's
    going to be groups all over France installing Linux and having a party at
    the same time!!! The group orgainising this is called AFUL (Which stands
    for <i>"Association Francophone des Utilisateurs de Linux et des logiciels
    libres"</i>, which means <i>"French-speaking Association of Linux and
    free software users"</i>), but we don't think they'll have an <i>"aful"</i> time on 10 October!!!!
    (DOH!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Minitel gets upgraded!!!!</h2>
  <p>Anyone remember Minitel?!?! Some of you French readers might be going
    <i>"Yes!!!"</i>, or rather <i>"Ah oui!!!"</i> (Because you're French!!!),
    because it's the old(ish) French version of Prestel- on steroids!!!!
    Unfortunately because it's been so successful in France, they've been a bit
    slow to embrace the Internet!!!! So <i>"Big Blue"</i>, which is IBM, not a
    porno company as you may think (Didn't we do this joke before?!??!?!?!),
    is helping them upgrade it a bit!!!!</p>

  <h2>Swedes might have cracked Internet Telephony!!!!</h2>
  <p>Internet Telephony is great isn't it?!?!?! Well, if the Internet is clear
    anyway, otherwise you get a syllable per minute if you're lucky!!!!!!! But
    two Swedish companies have apparently come up with some really spiffy way of
    getting around this prob!!! What's really interesting is that the technology
    was developed by Ericsson Telecom and Swedish Royal Institute of Technology,
    who are both Swedish and based in Sweden!!!!!! No Americans were
    involved!!!!! This must be a first!!!!</p>

  <h2>Watch out for the cow/horse, IRC people!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some weird trojan horse has been spread by IRC!!!!! For some odd reason,
    once installed, it requests a file from the webserver of Geocities. Even
    wierder, the file no longer exists!!!!!!!! The trojan is apaprently based
    on Back Orifice (See <a href="7.html#196"> issue 7</a>...) , and could be used
    to control people's machines from afar!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Well, they were getting more boring (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</a>...), 
    so we weren't too surprised when we saw that they've been sold off to
    Lycos, the equally boring search engine!!!!! Perhaps they should open a new
    site called <i>"Lycos & Wired's Really Really Boring Website"</i>!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Mobile phones with a difference!!!!</h2>
  <p>You remember on that nice little TV prog <i>"Bugs"</i>, where they're always
    talking to each other on mobile phones!??!?! Well, that bit will get a bit
    more expensive to do on telly now, as the first mobile video-phones using a
    global standard of mobile communication or something like that, have been
    released!!!! According to this informtive little article the phone comes in
    two forms: One is like <i>"Captain Kirk's personal communicator"</i>, and
    the other is like <i>"ladies' makeup case with a touch-sensitive
    LCD screen"</i> !!!!!! I never knew ladies' makeup cases had tough sensitive
    LCD screens!!!!!!! Technology is really moving fast these days isn't it?!</p>

  <h2>T-Rex: You're a wierdo!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you could ever go up to a dinosaur and go to it: <i>"You're really
    wierd!!!!!"</i>, what would happen?!?!??!?! Well, it would probably go:
    <i>"Yes, you're right!!!!"</i> Sounds unlikely?!?! Well it turns out that
    dinosaurs are not the gun-metal green/grey we thought they were from films
    like <i>"Jurassic Park"</i>!!!!!!!! In fact, this little article here goes as far as
    saying they looked more <i>"bizzare"</i> than we originally thought!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Bolivian dinosaur: You're a wierdo!!!!</h2>
  <p>Talking of <i>"bizzare"</i>- some people in Bolivia have found the footprints of
    a dinosaur- and they don't know what dinosaur it is!!!!!!! Shame the
    dinosaurs didn't didn't do a census and stuck it on the Internet!!!! It
    would have made things a lot more easier then!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>What do you do if you have a really really unfunny joke that's mildly
    topical?!?! Why, spread it around the newsgroups of <b>Usenet</b> like a
    bad rash of course!!!!!!</p>
  <p>The culprit this time is this really crap joke about <i>"EuroEnglish"</i>. Here's

  <h2>The Van Koevering Interactive Piano!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>There's this spiffy keyboard thingy called The "Van Koevering Interactive
    Piano", which allows you to compose, edit compositions, and print them
    out!!!! But that's boring!!!!!! We're really interested in the name: "Van
    Koevering Interactive Piano"!!! Really cool, huh?!?!? Remember where you
    heard it first, because we're sure by the end of the year the phrase
    "Van Koevering Interactive Piano" will be on everyone's lips!!!!!! I
    imagine loads of kiddies will be writing letters to Santa saying
    <i>"please please please Santa, can I have a 'Van Koevering Interactive

  <h2>The Boys from Brazil (Redmond)!!!!</h2>
  <p>What does Microsoft and Josef Mengeles have in common?!?!?!? Well, not
    much really- but the bods at MS are working on ways to "clone" copies
    of NT on different commputers across a network in order to make it
    easier to install stuff on a networked computer rather than installing
    it from a CD every time!!!! Presumably this is in response to the increased
    ease of installing Linux on computers, but we expect something similar
    to happen for Linux- if it hasn't happened already, and it's just not
    caught on yet!!!!!</p>

    cricket!!!!! Now, if this has you "stumped" (DOH!!!!!), let us explain!!!!!
    Those wonderful people from <b>MIT</b> have come up with these little boxy
    robots called <b>Crikets</b>, which can be programmed in that quaint
    little computer language called <b>Logo</b> that you probably remember
    from those BBC Microcomputers in school in the olden days... They can
    also communicate with each other as well!!!! Apparently they're being

    "Smart Quill" is supposed to be able to read writing as you actually write!!!
    It slots into a special "inkwell", which allows it to connect to the "proper"
    computer, and downloads all your writing!!!! (Which is just as well, as the
    screen on the pen is a little small!!!!!!) Only prob with this... It'll
    need a really smart quill to be able to read *<b>my</b>* handwriting!!!!!</p>

    in Internet commentary these days!!!! (See 
    <a href="../story=273.html#"> issue story=273</a>...) But check
    this out!!!!! <i>"We are in the midst of a global revolution,"</i>
    apparently!!!! That's not all- apparently the Internet is going to change
    our lives, in loads of ways that we don't know yet!!!!!!!!! If the best
    that this "expert" can come up with is the sort of dross we saw in early
    issues of internet mags from Future Publishing, then I hardly think we're
    dealing with the pre-millenial Nostradamus of Internet trends here!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>You don't have AIDS- you're just stoned!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If you're applying for a job at a big company, and they require you to take
    a urine test for HIV, don't worry!!!!! They might not be testing to see if
    you put "it" about a lot, they might just be checking to see if you're a
    20-a-day man, or an old hippy burn-out!!!!!!!! This is because there's this
    HIV1 urine test, which can also at the same time test for tobacoo and drugs
    use!!!! Of course, if you've got the HIV2 virus instead of HIV1, then you're
    okay!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Is Atom Ant to blame?!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Some dudes in the US are a bit worried because in the Washington state (Which
    is different from where Washingtion actually is!!!! One of these days, Bill
    Clinton is going to get mixed up, and then where will we be?!?!??!)) there's a
    whole lot of radioactive areas outside of the Hanford "nuclear reservation"
    (Wot, like for radioactive native americans?!??!), and they think it might
    be spread by <b>insects</b>!!!!! Like those big ants in that black and white
    movie from the 1950s "<b>Them!</b>"!!!!!! Well, OK, probably not like them,
    or somebody would have noticed!!!!!!!! Mind you, maybe someone did notice
    gigantic ants roaming around, but when they told anyone else they would answer
    <i>"Oh ha ha!!!!! That sounds exactly like that black and white
    movie from the 1950s '<b>Them!</b>'!!!!!!"</i>!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Surf your radiogram!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have your ever listened to Jimmy Young on the radio and thought: <i>"I wonder
    what it would be like if he had the dudes from Slashdot on the
    show?!?!??!"</i> Well, <b>packet radio</b> is an old techies way that's been
    used for yonks to connect to the internet by a small group of people, and now
    some dude is working on making it really popular!!!!! So he's come up with
    this really spiffy personal 200 Mbits/second packet radio connection
    to the Internet for around $500 US dollars, which is 3,112.05 Danish Kroner,
    as well as 291.27 quid!!! (That Yahoo! Exchange Rate section is really
    informative isn't it?!?!?!?!?) The only prob is that here in the UK, the
    fuddie-duddies at the Radio Authority probably won't like the idea of
    the "great unwashed" getting their hands on cheapo radio transmitters!!!!!
    It certainly give a new meaning to "Internet Radio" tho!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>The next Herman's Hermits!?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Well, whilst reading through a whole load of music newsgroups on Usenet, we've
    been noticing that a lot of young fellows are deciding to put their "demos"
    on the web for the general public to peruse!!!!!! So if you're jealous
    of that Holly person in the <b>Melody Maker</b>, who makes all those sarky
    comments about readers demo tapes, now's your turn!!!!!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>First off is this funny man whose name I've forgotten!!!!! But don't
        worry, my memory's not going!!!!! It's that it's easy to forget who
        it is because he's one of those "singer-songwriter" types!!!!!!
        Anyway, you can download his "art" in mp3 format, but if you can't
        be bothered with that, then it's okay, because he puts the lyrics to
        his songs on the websote!!! And of course, the lyrics are really
        important, because he's a "singer-songwriter" and writes really
        meaningful songs!!!!! So of course loads of people are going to want
        to read song lyrics from a complete stranger they've never heard
        of!!!!!!!!</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~rubin/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~rubin/</a></p>
    <li>
      <p>According to their website, the band <b>Mr Potato-Head</b> are a
        <i>"hoorney"</i> rock band!!!! That's a new category I've never heard
        of before!!!!! But I expect all the big bands will soon be doing
        "hoorney" stuff!!!! So when you hear Damon of Blur saying that there
        was always a "hoorney" element to their bands music, remember where
        you heard it first!!!! Anyway, this is apparently a Dutch "hard rock"
        band who apparently throw really good parties!!!! I wonder if they use
        a "Van Koevering Interactive Piano"?!?!?!?</p>

      <p><b>Protocol Productions</b> website has got loadsa frames, GFX, and

        exaggerating there!!!!!! It only takes a few minutes really!!!!) Mind
        you, when it does finally load, it looks really nice- like an old
        Amiga A500 demo turned into a website!!! There's lots of info on
        the website about his DJ "Crew", including detailed biogs which
        including their real names, which is really funny!!!!!! Then you
        can toddle over to their RealAudio "Mix" section, and listen to the
        latest "chunky chunes" played by "Darkforce 1 aka Ben Derrickson"!!!!
        Really "Slammin'"!!!!!!</p>
