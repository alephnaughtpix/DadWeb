    <h1>Double Digit Salute!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Yes!!!!!!!!!
    <p>We've made to issue 10!!!!!! A bit late because we were at the <b>Reservoir
      Cwmvention 1998</b> last week, but here it is!!!</p>
    <p>Another piece of good news!!!! You notice that little "webring" thingy on
      the left column of the webpage!!!!! Yes, that's right!!!!! We're on an ezine
      webring!!!! OK, you've probably been noticing it for the past couple of weeks,
      but it didn't quite work properly because we weren't actually accepted into
      it yet!!!! But now we're finally on the <b>E-zine Webring</b>, after a wait
      of about 3 weeks!!!! We were wondering why it was taking so long- then we
      realised that we forgot to send an email to the admin of the webring!!!!!!
      But that's fixed now!!!!</p>
    <p>One ultra-annoying thing tho- in the past couple
      of weeks, the Coollist mailing list server which SC transmits it's email
      versh on has gone into meltdown!!! It's probably due to that "Clinton"
      business being discussed on a couple of mailing lists, but when Coollist
      finally resurrected itself earlier this week, it had imposed a 20K limit on
      messages, which means I'll probably need to split the email versh into two
      parts!!!! Bah!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Negativland to make Teletubbies single?!?!</h2>
  <p>You might remember Negativland and their lovely little website... (See <a href="9.html#266">issue
    9</a>...) Well, check this out from the "Coming Attractions" section!!! Among
    the things they are working on is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>"<b>SECRET SINGLE</b>
      <p>Something to do with a number one world wide hit single, a very popular
        childrens' televison show and...anarchism."</i>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hmmmm.... I wonder what that could be!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.negativland.com/attractions/coming.html">http://www.negativland.com/attractions/coming.html</a></p>
  <p>Unfortunately for them, <b>Cruel Site of the Day</b> has beat them to the
    idea!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.cruel.com/images/unatubby.gif">http://www.cruel.com/images/unatubby.gif</a></p>
  <p>Cruel Site of the Day is a really cool site BTW!!! Check it out at: <a href="http://www.cruel.com/">http://www.cruel.com/</a></p>
  <p>BTW we've just found out that Negativland is actually named after some track
    by one of those "alternative" German groups from the early 70s!!!! Why they
    didn't name themselves after a more snappily-titled track like "Morgenspaziergang"
    we don't know!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>The most sarcastic newsgroup ever?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, we've been reading <a href="news://alt.music.mp3/">news://alt.music.mp3/</a> for
    some "tips" on MP3 music, and we've been finding some rather sarcastic responses
    to common questions....</p>
  <pre class="usenet">Loth wrote in message &lt;6tes9d$ejo$1@front2.grolier.fr&gt;...
&gt;Does anybody know if there's a way to read midi files with Winamp ?
&gt;If the answer is "no", is there a way to convert mid to mp3 ???
&gt;
&gt;Thx in advance
&gt;
&gt;Loth
&gt;
&gt;
<p>
Yeah. In winamp click on open then select your midi file.</pre>

hmmm....maybe running you sound cards output to your tapedecks input....</pre>
  <p>At least, we <i>assume</i> they're sarcastic...</p>

  <p>OK... Scientests are pretty "testy" at the best of times!!!!!! But seriously,
    this week they've been grappling with an unknown "force", so they're even
    more annoyed!!! It appears that the outer space probes have had their paths

  <h2>'Blue Screen of Death' could literally kill you- thanks to a slug!!!</h2>
  <p>"Dr. Dennis Willows" from University of Washington wants to
    "implant a tiny silicon chip in a sea slug". And he's managed to get
    money from Microsoft to go right ahead and do it!!!!! You might wonder
    what's so great about sticking a silicon chip in a slug... Well, it's to
    see how it's memory works of course!!!! And to find a "man-machine" type
    computer-human interface that doesn't rely on Windows!!!!! So some time in
    the future we'll all be wearing red shirts and talking German like those
    cheeky Kraftwerk chappies with implanted chips running in our brains running
    Microsoft systems!!! Wow!!!! That will be something to look forward to!!! I
    just hope they fix the "Blue Screen of Death" by then tho!!!!!</p>

  <h2>End of the PCs?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>You might think that reading this on a computer is a good idea, but have you
    ever thought of reading it off a Tyrannosaurus Rex?!?!?! Well, in the future
    you might be doing both!!!!!! That's because according to the
    <b>Economist</b>, your computer will become a dinosaur!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
    the market is shifting from big "do everything" desktop PCs to many little
    devices to do specialised thingies...</p>

    'Ere" or something really "political" on the webpage ?!?!?!?
    No!!!!! You would of course use the computing power to compute extremely

  <h2>Memo to Security services- Don't put top secrets on tha W3!!!</h2>
  <p>What would you do if you've got a whole load of of top secrets?!?!?! Put it on
    a website where everyone can see it of course!!!!!! Well, unless you're
    someone like the Pentagon!!!!!! They've just got round to realising that
    putting sensitive data on a publicly available website might not be a good
    idea!!!! And they're doing a search on their websites to check there's no
    secret stuff!!! "Loose lips sink ships" they say!!!! Well, of course loose
    lips sink ships- if they keep dribbling on long enough, it'll waterlog the
    ship and it'll sink!!!! But I don't see what that's got to do with the
    websites!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    But I wonder what it would be like to be *<b>really</b>* on another planet?!?!?"
    Well, such a thought been never far from my mind!!!!!! But a whole load of
    astronomers must be thinking the same thing, because they're trying to find
    planets around other stars!!! And they've hit on the original idea that:
    <i>"To look at the planet you need to get rid of the starlight"</i>!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Do the 'South Park', man!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might not be terribly impressed by "South Park", but watch out,
    it's going to get even worse, as they're going to "Do The Bartman" by
    releasing a novelty single, which will probably go to No. 1 for zillions of
    weeks!!!! It's by "Master P" and it's a "rap" called, wait for it, "Kenny's
    Dead"!!!! Ho ho. Even worse it's the "flagship" single from a whole "South
    Park" album!!!! It's probably going to be even more embarrasing than "The
    Simpsons Sing The Blues"!!!</p>

    Apache, the world's no. 1 webserver (So it's like The Spice Girls of
    webservers!!!) has got support for sending compressed webpages, but so far
    no web browser supported it- until now!!!!! The <b>Mozilla</b> project to
    make the next <b>Netscape</b> browser has included it- and since text files
    compress really well, this sort of thing can make a really big difference!!!!

    all the "white stuff" on the infamous Monica Lewinsky dress (ie The one that
    she didn't wash for two years!!!!) is not all what you might think- some of
    it is allegedly cocaine!!!!!! Anyway, also in this "story": apparently 25%
    of the staff have a "history" of drug use... Well come on, some of them must
    have come from 60s, so what do you expect!!!!!!!!!</p>

    won't be impressed!!! Why not?!?! Well, HD manufacturers expect disk drives
    will reach their limit of compactness by 2004!!! By then, they expect we'll
    have HDs that can store 8000 MB an inch!!!! Luckily they've got a little

  <h2>Watch Tori Amos whilst loading a webpage!!!!</h2>
  <p>The latest little toy on the SDWWWHQ Stealth Ninja AWACs web browsey-wowsey
    is this wierd thingie called <b>Zing!</b> Yes, I know it sounds like one of
    those Children's ITV progs from the 80s with Gaz Top on it, but it's actually
    a strange program which loads visuals and stuff while you're on the Internet,
    but not actually downloaing anything, and then when you click on a webpage,
    you get a bit of these visuals appearing whilst you're waiting for the page
    to download!!!! It's actually a pretty decent idea, but we think the content
    will have to get better before it really catches on!!!! There are numerous
    "channels" which "broadcast" about 15 secs of Shockwave Flash animation, one
    of them is a "famous quotes" chan, another is a "Learn French" spot, and then
    there's one devoted to music "clips" from various bands reviewed in a US
    magazine called "Rolling Stone", who appear to be devoted to exactly the same
    sort of bands covered in that book I did last year called <i>"First Against
    the Wall When the Revolution Comes: A Guide to Who's Who In Dull-But-Worthy
    Music"</i>!!!!</p>
  <p>Once they get more exciting stuff on their "channels", and, even better, allow
    users to make their own content, then they'll really be laughing!!!!</p>

    need and that's to be blown to bits by a rock from space!!!! But that might
    possibly happen in a couple of months, as the "Leonids" meteors hit the
    Earth!!!! They're actually quite small rocks, so they'll get burned up by the
    Earth's atmosphere, but they may hit satellites outside the atmos, and since
    they're travelling at a hefty speed, they may cause a little damage!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>A modern way of doing Post-modernist essays!!!!!</h2>
  <p>If I were to say to you that I could do a whole big long essay on
    postmodernism in a jiffy, you might think I was really clever, but I
    wouldn't be!!!!! And neither would the essay, as it would be a load of made
    up bollox!!!!! The only thing that would be really clever was that it would be
    made up by a computer program called the "<b>Dada Engine</b>" which was
    fixed up to act as a "Postmodern Essay Generator"!!!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the <b>Slashdot</b> crowd have just found out about it, so the
    resulting increase in traffic has probably killed the flippin' server!!!!!
    So just in case, here's a couple of example essays someone did earlier!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Here's the whole "<b>Dada Engine</b>" thingy!!!! It works on Unix type
    systems, and you can use it to make convincing random texts in any style!!!!
    Hmmm... I wonder if the "lads" at <b>Loaded</b> mag use it to make up the
    letters for the letter pages!??!?! They certainly couldn't do much worse!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Space Invaders- on a prism?!??!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what Pacman would look like on a rotating cube?!?!?
    How about Frogger on a dodecahedran?!?! Or even Donkey Kong on an isoceles
    triangle?!?!?!??!?! Well, that day might not be so far away!!!!! Someone in
    the ultra-hip Linux "scene" has done a version of that spiffy arcade emulator
    <b>MAME</b> using <b>Open GL</b>, which means all those old games will be
    able to take advantage of all the lovely texture-mapping facilities on your
    ultra-hep 3D card!!!!! I can't to see Defender mapped on a 3D fourier
    transform of a transverse sine wave tho!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Computers = non-human intelligence?!??!</h2>
  <p>But watch out!!!!!!!! If you try and map Double Dragon onto a double-donut,
    the computer might get a bit annoyed!!!! Sounds unlikely?!?!?! Well, not
    according to George B. Dyson, who thinks that computers are already on their
    way to becoming intelligent, and even today they way computers "act" can
    appear to humans as corresponding to "emotions" and "behaviour"!!!!!!</p>
  <p>I know what this guy means!!!!! My computer gets "tired" if I run Windows 95
    on it for too long, and it stops working!!! Then, I have to switch it off, to
    give it a "rest", and then later when I "wake" it up, it's "better" again!!!!</p>
