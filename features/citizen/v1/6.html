    <h1>Monica Lewinsky- What's she going to look like with a chimney on her!?!?!?</h1>
    <p>Well, it might not seem as big as last week, but
      my computer was away for a day and a half getting fixed!!! Now
      I don't have to bang it to get it to work!!!!! Actually, if
      this issue *<b>does</b>* seem as big as last week, you can ignore this paragraph!!!!!!</p>
    <p>If some of you tried to get on the website last weekend, you might have 
      had trouble, as both the <a href="http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/" target="">Grelb</a> 
      server and the name server for the Senior Dads site went down!!!!! But 
      it's okay now- and anyway, I've got a backup server in case the Grelb 
      one goes down... Yes, it's happened before!!!! Just before the weekend 
      we launched our <b><a href="../../../demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a></b> 
      demo, our website went down!!! So, I quickly registered at one of the 
      zillions of free website hosting thingies, and made up the <b><a href="http://members.theglobe.com/seniordads/">Senior 
      Dads But 'n' Ben</a></b> site, and redirected the nameserver there!!! 
      The only reason I didn't do it again last week was that the bloody nameserver 
      was also broken down!!!! Bah!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Anyway, contrary to expectations, the mailing list edition of Senior Citizen still
      works!!!! So you email guys probably won't have noticed any difference!!!! So I
      probably wasted my time typing this!!! Doh!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Our names go into space?!?!</h2>
  <p>We've only just found out about this at the last minute!!!! 15th Aug is the 
    deadline if you want your name to go into space, so it'll be too late now!!! 
    Some satellite is going into space with a couple of microchips with squillions 
    of people's names on it, and has allowed people to submit names... So of 
    course, we've put all the names of the Senior Dads into the list!!! Tho, 
    who knows what aliens will think when they see the following names...</p>

  <p>Look at this article!!! 
    Looks like the Beeb found out about the Slashdot crew being a bit sceptical 
    about their "Peter Parker" story... (See <a href="5.html#152"> issue 
    5</a>...)</p>

  <h2>This boat is a load of rubbish!!!</h2>
  <p>Literally!!!! It's made of recycled rubbish from New York, 
    and has just sailed from New York, across the Atlantic, to London!!!! Presumably 
    the crew were wearing noseplugs or something!!! I hope there wasn't a dustbin 
    lorry at the London port, or the boat might not have lasted very long!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>The C64 is back!!!! (Again!!!!)</h2>
  <p>... As a webtop compute!!! And it's running Windows 3.1 
    and DOS!!!! And it's called the "Web.It"!!!! I wonder if the 
    squillion who are currently still using C64s (It is the 
    most popular home computer in history!!!), especially the demo 
    sceners, will be accomodating to these young Web.it upstarts!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Price Wars at Star Wars!!!</h2>
  <p>Anyone jealous at the US getting the first look of the next
    Star Wars movie?!?! Well, don't be, because the fact that
    they're getting it first means that it might be more
    expensive for them to see it there!!! Apparently the fact
    that no-one really knows exactly how it's going to perform
    (Well, you never know, it might not do well!!! Aliens might
    land before May 1999, or a meteorite might hit New York!!!!),
    combined with the fact that it's most anticipated movie
    of all time, means that the cinemas might hike up the price
    just in case it's a dud!!! They figure that the people who be
    wanting to see it first won't be too fussy about paying
    higher prices!!!</p>
  <p>At least by the time it hits everywhere, we'll know if
    it's a success or not, so the ticket price probably will have
    settled down by then!!!!</p>

  <h2>Here's one to think about...</h2>
  <p>Haven't you ever thought... Well, obviously you have!!!! Well, now
    you can record it!!!! Some company's done this thingy called an
    Interactive Brainwave Visual Analyzer, and are giving a bit of a
    plug on their rather interesting webpage!!! Apparently you
    put this funny band with electrodes in around your head and you
    can control software and stuff... But's really boring!!! What we
    found really interesting were some of the wacky phrases they were
    coming up with on their webpage, like... <i>"Let your brain do
    it's brain thing", "Technical Yummy!", "Check the Freak'n
    Software!!!!", "The ultimate machine based mind extender????!"</i>,
    and loads of other gems!!!! We're printing out this webpage in
    case we need some inspiration!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Like Pingu, only smarter!!!</h2>
  <p>A talking penguin!!!! In fact, it's a talking robot penuin with intelligence!!!!
    As usual, MIT are to blame for this one!!! It's one of their robot thingies, which
    is actually meant to be a teaching tool, to teach kiddies about computer and
    robots!!! Though I think it will probably scare them to death, especially if they're
    French, because the thingie's called "Mort", and "Mort" is French for "dead"!!!!!!
    But it's "technical yummy" anyway!!! (That's a phrase from that webpage, BTW!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Spartan Horse!!!</h2>
  <p>And you thought the Spartan Horse was what William Wallace rode in
    the film Braveheart!!!! Well, you're wrong!!!!! It's actually use of
    a Javascript dialog thingy in a web page to look like a Windows
    dialog, so it can fool the user into typing stuff like a password
    request and similar naughty stuff!!!! Oddly enough, made-up Javascript
    windows and dialogs look more like Windows dialogs if you're using
    Micrsoft Internet Explorer!!!! Looks like this integrating the browser
    into the operating system wasn't such a good idea!!!!!</p>
  <p>So if you ever surf with IE, and get confronted with a strange "Windows"
    dialog asking you for your password, just "Let your brain do
    it's brain thing"!!!! (That's another phrase from the webpage, great
    isn't it?!?!?!)</p>

  <h2>Cheap Computes!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, comparatively cheap anyway by US standards!!! Someone's selling
    a PC with 180MZh Cryix MMX thingy procesa, 22 Migo Ram, 1.6 gigawatts
    HD, 24 speedy CD, 33.6 kilojoules per second modem for $399, which is
    Â£250 in UK prices... So they've managed in the US to get round to
    a PC that costs the same as the ol' Beeb Model A used to cost!!! I
    can't wait till they get round to making the PC as reliable as the
    old Beeb tho!!!! Technical yummy!!!!</p>

  <h2>Win 98 users- don't boot your computer at 11:59!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Looks like what was first thought to be a millenium bug, then an
    end-of-every-year bug (See <a href="5.html#156"> issue 5</a>...), 
    is actually an end-of-every-day bug!!!! If you boot your computer
    at 11:59 at night, the date in your clock goes funny!!!!! To MS we
    say: "Check the Freak'n software"!!!!!! (That's another phrase from
    the webpage, BTW!!! Great, eh!?!?!?)</p>

  <h2>Say hello to our new reader- the NSA!!!</h2>
  <p>According to this interesting little article, the US shadowy types you see on the
    <i>X-Files</i>, the <b>National Security Agency (NSA)</b> have this system called <b>Echelon</b>,
    which can intercept emails going in and out and around the US which contain key phrases
    they're looking for!!! Just think- our mailing list is provided by a US server,
    so we can immediately increase our readership just by using key phrases like
    "subversive activities", "hacking", "Iraqi chemical weapons programme", "bombing
    of US embassy in Kenya", and "Monica Lewinsky"!!! Anyway, hello NSA people- hope
    you like this issue!!!! Oh, and "Let your brain do it's brain thing"!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Do they listen to Rock music?!?!</h2>
  <p>"And now, we're solid!!!!! (Wooh!!! Yeah!! etc) Solid as a rock!!!!!!"
    So sang <b>Ashford &amp; Simpson</b> in the 1980s, (And so did some of my friends,
    except that did a very rude version, which substituted "rock" for a very rude word!!!!)
    but I bet they wouldn't say the same about rocks with rock eating microbes in
    them!! These microbes have been found one mile below the surface of the sea by
    an ocean drilling program. Well, not actually the microbes themselves, but fossils
    of them... Sounds familiar!?!?! Yep, it's like that story about the meteorite from
    Mars with funny marks that might be microbe fossils. They're a bit more sure about
    the sea ones tho, so it's started up the Mars meteorite debate again!! I think the
    scientests had better let their brain do their collective brain thing!!!!! (OK, I'll
    go easy on those hip phrases now!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Now- in living colour!!!!</h2>
  <p>Talking of funny bacteria, how about putting some in your screen?!?!?! Well, that's what
    Bell labs are wanting to do!!! They're now working on ultra-thin screens which use
    bacteria proteins which change according to electrical charge. So if your screen
    "dies", it'll give a new meaning to "bugs" and "viruses"!!!! (Doh!!!!!!) I suppose
    you could call those bacteria screens "Technical <b>YUKKY</b>"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Arg!!! Nurse!!!!!!)</p>
  <p>Oh no- I've said "bugs"!!!! The NSA people will be reading this again!!!!</p>

    with one of the office staff- big wow!!!) In Israel, in a TV ad, some FBI agents
    are taking away some dress off a "Monika Lavinsky" and washing it- yes you

  <h2>Like a colour Gameboy- only smarter!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, I've been getting really interested in the various new tiny computers that
    are coming out, especially those than can run the same systems you get on biggy
    computers!!!! One of the "big names" is Palm Computing, who do those PalmPilots,
    which apparently are the fastest selling new hardware since the Mac came out, or
    something like that... Anyway, their latest is going to have a colour display, and
    have spiffy infrared connections to the "big" PCs, and they're even talking about
    wireless connections!!! It's apparently called "Razor" or something, so I'll be
    able to say: "I've got a wireless and razor in my pocket, just like I did in the
    War!!"!!!!!! (I had big pockets though!!!)</p>

  <h2>Catching the flu for a living!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what it will be like to be a gravedigger on the moon 
    in the year 3543?!?!! Well some people are going to find out this 
    week, as there's an expedition to the frozen bits in north of Norway, where 
    it's colder than a snowman's cold bits (!!!!), and people are going to dig 
    up graves whilst wearing spacesuits!!!! The reason being that they believe 
    that in the permafrost there may still be frozen traces of the Spanish flu 
    (??? Maybe they misspelled "Spanish Fly" or something!!!! Though what it's 
    doing in Norway is beyond me!!!! Perhaps he took a wrong turn at Alberquerque 
    like Bugs Bunny!!!!!!) which was apparently really bad during the First World 
    War, and they want to get a vaccine against it and so on... One thing tho- how 
    do they know if they've got the bug!?!?! I mean, they'll catch their death 
    of cold up in the Arctic Circle anyway!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Don't get ripped off by the Americans!!!</h2>
  <p>You know, last night, I saw the Beatles "Blue" compil on sale on CD on QVC- for 
    Â£29.40!!!!!! Flippin' eck!!! You can get the thing on vinyl for a few quid 
    secondhand!!! What do you mean, "get on with it!!"?!?!?! Well, there's a lot 
    more of this online shopping lark happening, so you may soon be shopping 
    from the odd US site here and there, so how do you know you're not getting 
    ripped off?!?! Well, here's one idea- there's now a search engine for online 
    shoppers, so you can compare prices!!!! So you can make sure that there's 
    no QVC style ripoffs- I mean, they were also selling the "Red" compil for 
    Â£29.40!!!!! The "Red" compil's so small it can fit in a single CD, so I'm 
    not paying a flippin' pound per track!!!! Fume, fume!!!!</p>

    of humour, as they've called the virus "Strange Brew"!!!!!!!!! (!!!!) I don't 
    know about the claim on the article here that it's the first cross platform

  <h2>MP3 sites review: Old Fart slags off MP3 lamers!!!!</h2>
  <p>Ever since Colostomy Bag told me about this new fangled MP3 thing, I've been 
    interested to see what resources there are on the fabulous megamighty infowebby 
    thingy!!! So I subscribed to a couple of the MP3 Usenet groups... When I suddenly 
    found I was having to download a few meg a day of crap incomplete UUencoded 
    MP3s, I decided perhaps it wasn't such a good idea!!! (You know the sort of 
    thing- some Korn track or whatever, UUencoded into 7 parts, except that part 4 
    is missing, and there's 2 copies of part 3!!!)</p>
  <p>What I did get from the messages tho was a few links to various "unofficial" 
    download sites!!!! (Woo!!! Naughty or what!!!) So, Old Fart, serious investigative 
    journalist (!!!!!), went along and had a look at a few of the sites!!!</p>
  <p>Of course I have to say here that downloading copyrighted music
    is not big and not clever!!!!! However, neither are the sites!!!! Some
    of them are really crap!!!! Some of them appear to be linked with those
    "warez" sites, which is probably why they've got loads of porno ads all
    over them and why they have the world's worst web design!!!!!!</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>"MP3 2000"</b></dt>
    <dd>This promises much, but most of it's not bloody working!!! Try
      testing the site before you advertise it on Usenet, you idiots!!</dd>
    <dt><b>"MP3 Charts"</b></dt>
    <dd>This is really interesting!!!! It's a sort of Top of the Pops of
      MP3s!!!! All the usual chart stuff you see on the chart shows are
      on here!! Unfortunately for the same reason, it's not really full
      of stuff you'd want to download!!!!</dd>
    <dt><b>"Rock, Pop & Rap MP3s"</b></dt>
    <dd>Bit wierd this one- it apparently has "rock, pop & rap", but is
      rather broad in what it considers... "Pop" includes Aqua and Eric
      Clapton, whilst rap is really wide- Rage Against the Machine's
      "Killing in the Name" rub shoulders with German ravey guys
      Scooter!!!</dd>
    <dt><b>"Top 50 MP3 Sites"</b></dt>
    <dd>This site, which is a Top 50 list of other MP3 sites, is one of the most
      irritating websites I have ever had the mispleasure of visiting!!!!
      Windows pop from nowhere when you select something- then you get
      the top 50 list, and after 10 seconds, the browser suddenly loads
      another page advertising the rest of the site!!!! When you select
      sites, some may pop up in yet another window or they may not!!!
      As soon as I actually got something from this site, I just picked
      a link and left quickly!!!!</dd>
    <dt><b>"MP3 Sound page"</b></dt>
    <dd>This site looks like one of those mysterious "warez" sites you hear
      of, but the choice appears reasonable.... Interestingly, the version
      of Aqua's "Barbie Girl" is completely different from the original!!! It
      purports to be a "remix" but sounds suspiciously like someone
      in their back bedroom knocking together a "happy hardcore" track
      on a couple of cheap MIDI keyboards, and overlaying a bad sample
      of the vocals at the start of the original!!!! Just as well I had to
      delete it so as to stay within the law!!!! (Officer!!!)</dd>
    <dt><b>"MPFreeLand"</b></dt>
    <dd>This is a a little better- there's a bit more of an interesting
      and varied choice of music here, including rather Dire Strait's
      "Telegraph Road"!!!! Hmm... yes, I'm sure someone will be brave
      enough to try and download this 14 minute track!!!! They'll
      need a whole day to download it tho!!!! Mind you, it's not all worthy muso stuff,
      I also saw they had listed that delightful "what's she going to look like
      with a chimney on her" ditty!!!!</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>What?!?! You expected me to give the URLs?!?!?!? You're mad!!!!</p>
