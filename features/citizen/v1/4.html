    <h1>National Smile Week!!!</h1>
    <p>Well, that was a very nice little trek around the islands of Scotland!!!
      And now, I'm back!!! And... What!!! You notice the difference?!?!? Yep,
      I've been tinkering around with the look a little, so don't be surprised
      if you see a few more changes!!!! (If you're reading this in email, you'd
      better come to the website or else!!!!)</p>
    <p>Now that the number of articles has broke the 100 mark, I've also added an
      archive of all the articles featured!!! Great thing database programming,
      isn't it!?!?</p>
    <p>BTW I'm wondering if I should change the title of this organ slightly, as some people
      might have never heard of the <a href="../../../"><b>Senior Dads</b></a>,
      and so might be confused by the title "<b>Senior Citizen</b>"!!! Colostomy Bag
      has suggested I might change the title to "<b>Senior Netzien</b>". What do you
      think!??!</p>

  <h2>Young 'un Internet Advisor!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember Doogie Howser!?!? Well, here's the Internet equivalent!!! The Jamaican
    govt. has appointed a 13 yo kid, one Makonnen David Blake Hannah, as "youth
    technology consultant", which makes him the youngest government consultant
    in the world!!! Well done, Mak!!</p>

  <h2>Record your soundcard in Linux!!</h2>
  <p>I saw this <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a>, but this
    is too intresting to miss out!! Some dude's done a program for Linux systems
    to record whatever's being output by the soundcard, so obviously even stuff
    that can't be saved or copied can still be read and saved!!! Of course, as
    the author says, that would be very naughty, so don't do it!!!</p>

  <h2>Who's being nasty to who!??!</h2>
  <p>As reported last issue, RealAudio were claiming that Microsofts media player
    nobbled their RealPlayer upon installation. Well, just after we sent out
    issue 3, we heard that MS we claiming that it was RealAudio's fault- they
    hadn't set themselves up in the registry properly!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/7-23realnet2.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/7-23realnet2.htm</a></p>
  <p>But RealAudio hit back pretty quickly- seems like they're definately sure
    it's MS doing the dirty, and Real have got a few others to give some evidence
    as well!!!</p>

  <p>The cartoon cable/satellite channel Cartoon Network have just put up their
    new website, and it's rather nice-looking!!! Best bit is the section devoted
    to "Dexter's Laboratory"- BBC2 show this cartoon now!!! And "Cow &amp; Chicken"
    and "Johnny Bravo" if you can get it...</p>

  <p>I didn't even know they were attempting this!!! But, yes, apparently the

    but now they can't- apparently they don't have the money or something...</p>

  <h2>Yet more bloody waiting for the 'apocalypse'!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you can't keep a good US survivalist down!!! After zillions of other
    possible apocalypse scenarios have fallen by the wayside in a non-apocalyptic
    manner, they find another one as an excuse for their wacky behaviour!! And
    the latest one is actually quite a reasonable bet for them- no society breaking
    down or Wormwood hitting the Earth type nonsense, it's our old friend, the
    Millenium Bug!!! They're fearing all the computers and stuff stopping and
    society breaking down and all the other survivalist cliches!!! "I look at
    it as Judgment Day," one of the dudes rather predictably says... (How come
    you never hear of survivalists who are Buddhists or into some other religion?!?!
    I mean a survivalist that talked like Yoda- now that would be cool!!!!)</p>

  <p>Meanwhile one bunch that look as though they won't be too badly are the insurance
    companies!!!! In the US, they've been busy getting permission to exclude
    claims resulting from the Millenium bug!!!!</p>

  <h2>Smart Paint!??!?!</h2>
  <p>Sounds wierd, but it's "micro-electro mechanical systems" time again!!
    We're not just talking about little machines that you can hold in your
    hand, but machines so tiny that they be held in suspension in a liquid,
    like paint!!! So you can "paint" a speaker or TV screen!!! The LA Times
    reports says somthing about some boy and his "purple crayon", which
    sounds a bit rude!!!!</p>

  <h2>Scotland the Raw finally released!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, a week after 
    they were supposed to have originally released it (See <a href="3.html#59"> 
    issue 3</a>...) , the first issue of the Scottish "Private Eye" style 
    ezine is out!!!! It's in email form, as the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> 
    website isn't up yet ATM, and the Gamerush address (See below) just 
    gives a pointer to a subscribe address to the email-delivered zine (Well, 
    at least it was- the actual pages appear to have disappeared Thurs 8 
    Aug!!!)</p>
  <p>Anyway, the "Late transmition to allow the competition to exhaust themselves !"
    excuse for it being one week late was apparently in reference to a
    concerted attack on by some hackers!!!! Maybe the hackers read the
    Sunday times interview!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, despite the claim on the Gamerush page that "Contrary to the press we
    have received, this publication is supposed to be an entertaining look at
    Scotland, not scandalous", Scotland the Raw starts off very much like a
    Private Eye style mag!!! One of the people involved is apparently a paid-up
    member of the Labour party, and the editor is quoted in the Sunday Times
    interview as not really supporting independence for Scotland, so maybe this
    explains why the scandal stuff appears to be mostly about Labours main
    rivals in Scotland, the independence-supporting SNP!!!! Mind you, the
    "top" story about selection of SNP candidates isn't quite as juicy as
    the Eye stories about selection in the Labour camp- in fact, the whole
    thing appears incredibly waffly!!! Hardly the "designed to be easily
    digested titbits of salacious rumour which can be read on a coffee break"
    business we were promised in the Sunday Times interview!!! OK, I'm used
    to extremely compact ezines like Need to Know (<a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a> ),
    but I thought e-zine items were supposed to be short!!! (eg this is
    the longest article I've ever written for Senior Citizen!!!)</p>
  <p>Even, wierder, just when it seems to be chugging along like one of those funny 
    mags you used to get at Poll Tax demonstrations, then... "Gaming"!!!! 
    Huh!?!? Private Eye didn't have a computer games section!!!! What 
    we get is a report from the E3!!!! (Yep, a bit late, isn't it!!! (See 
    <a href="0.html#"> issue 0</a>...) ) It's subtitled "Cutting Through 
    the Hype!", but you have to wonder about that, since the whole gaming 
    section is actually "provided by <a href="http://www.gamerush.com">http://www.gamerush.com</a> 
    part of Reality X Interactive"!!! Who?!?!? Yes, it's from the same 
    company who do Scotland the Raw!!! No hype there I guess!!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, it was just as boring as you
    might imagine: so and so was on display at this stall yawn ZzzzZzzz...
    Why do all reports from games exhibitions sound incredibly boring?!?!
    Slightly more interesting was the mention of Scottish gaming firms,
    which you don't usually hear of in the gaming press. Given that this is
    supposed to be some sort of "Scottish" maggy, it would be pretty
    interesting to hear a bit more about Scottish games firms!!!!!</p>
  <p>After that, another bizzare switch- this time to "Social Scotland", with
    what is apparently a "review" of T in the Park (A bit more up-to-date
    than the E3!!!!)!!!! I say "apparently", because the first 3 of the 6
    paras are taken up with a rant about events in the hospitality tent,
    which develops into what appears to be yet another slag off of the
    SNP!!!! The next para says something about some "gig ban", and then
    the last 2 (very short) paras are about the actual bloody concerts!!!!
    I think it says a lot that the "reviewer" apparently really liked
    Robbie Williams, Prodigy, The Seahorses, Catatonia, Super Furry Animals,
    and Spiritualized- but couldn't say very much about it!!!!</p>
  <p>In general, I think Scotland the Raw is pretty interesting for a first
    issue!!! I think they could perhaps be a bit more even in style, instead
    of jumping from Private Eye to The Edge to The List in quick
    succession!!! (And get rid of those Gamesrush castoffs!! it's pretty
    obvious!!!) The writing is pretty good, but could be a bit less waffly (Go read Wired News
    or Need to Know!!!), the reviews could actually *review* the bloody things,
    and there are pretty obvious political biases- either be bit more
    even-handed, or just be honest about them!!! In general, I think they
    have good potential, and with a bit of work, could be quite decent!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm">http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm</a></p>
  <p>If that doesn't work, why not try emailing them direct and asking for a
    subscription to the zine? And tell them to fix the web page while they're
    at it!!!!</p>

  <h2>Now this is a bit fast!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember when spiffy high-end computer systems used be promoted in terms
    of how many "mips" (millions of instructions/sec) could be done by the
    machine?!?! Well, IBM's now done a machine that can do BIPS!!!! No, I'm
    not talking about the noises from a Sinclair Speccy, or some computer
    simulation of a French mime artist!!! I'm talking billions of instructions
    per second!!! Or 1,040 MIPS to be exact!! The only thing that's faster
    is milk- because it's "pasturised" before you see it!!! (DOH!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Millenium MP3!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have seen a previous issue and seen the first major label release of an 
    MP3 "single", (See <a href="2.html#"> issue 2</a>...) but wondered why 
    they chose to launch it with a bunch of non-entities from San Franciso, 
    well things have changed a bit this week!!!! Goodnoise, some internet 
    music company thingy has started selling downloadable music, and the 
    artist they've started with is Frank Black!!!!!! Yes!!!! The character 
    from the cult series "Millenium"!!!!! You can get a couple of sample 
    tracks from his album, and then buy the full thing later!!!! I wonder 
    if he says "Solyent Green Is People" in this one?!??!?!</p>

    encoded beam of light through the pupil to the retina, stimulating the
    receptors on the back of the eye. The user has the impression
    of viewing a high quality video image an arm's length away." Woo!!!

  <h2>Don't use MS Outlook if you want to threaten someone with violent death!!!</h2>
  <p>I saw this "interesting" little story on the message board of Squid's
    Amiga pages... A couple of friends at a scottish Uni had a regular "fight
    by email" going!!! A bit like those role-playing by email type games, except
    it's one person doing a "fight" move against the other eg "I kick you", then
    "I've dodged your kick and hit you back" and so on!!! Then they both landed
    an inbetween-terms work placement at the same company!!!! So they carried on
    the "fight" at the company...
  <p>Unfortunately, when one of them sent his
    latest message, apparently for some reason (Either the email addr was
    typed incorrectly or the prog tried "guessing" halfway through typing!!!)
    MS Outlook Express, the proggy used, tried to guess who was being sent to,
    and came up with the email addr of this guy's boss!!!! So now, he's
    looking for a new placement...

  <p>I've read something on Digitiser News (p171 UK C4 teletext) about

    the Atari demo scene like us, you'll know that there's already a well-known
    "CIH" in the form of Chris Holland the editor of the well-known Atari
    diskmag "Maggie"!!! Anyway, it turns out that this is the BIOS-killing
    virus we were going on about last issue!!!! Boy these media types are

  <h2>Take a tip from Smiley on the encryption!!!!</h2>
  <p>What with all those 12903 bit encryptions getting cracked in record time by loads of people, 
    you'd think all this encryption business was pretty insecure!!! And 
    you'd be right!!!! But one software company has decided to rip off 
    all the old spy techniques of coding their messages using "manual hardware" 
    means- in this case, the old "one-time-pad" stuff, where everytime 
    the message is envcrypted differently according to a page in a "pad", 
    which is only used once, then destroyed!!! Only problem is... How do 
    you do that in a software form and make *that* secure?!?! You'd have 
    to transmit the "pad" to someone so that they can receive your messages, 
    so if someone intercepts that, then bang goes your security!!! The 
    software dudes are currently using normal key encryption to transmit 
    the "pads", so that can be broken!!!! To be really secure, you'd probably 
    have to keep the last "page" of the current "pad" in order to encrypt 
    the transmission of the next pad!!!!!</p>

  <p>A couple of people at our web provider have recently had people fakemailing 
    spam using their email addresses as the return address!!!!! So we know 
    how Peter Hall might feel when he was mistakenly accused of being a 
    spammer by Earthlink!!! But this being America, he's of course brought 
    out the lawyers to say exactly how chessed off he is, and is suing Earthlink 
    for stuff like libel and so on!!!! If he wins this, it'll certainly 
    change the way ISPs deal with spammers, because this sort of stuff 
    is getting a bit more common as spammers are getting more desperate!!!!</p>

    things called "microtremors" in a voice!!!! (Wonder
    what would happen on a bad line!!!!) Only prob is
    that Jimmy would have to plug the phone booth into

  <pre class="usenet">I'LL PULL PLUG ON SCOTLAND

By ALLAN CALDWELL

Evening Times Thu 6 Aug 1998 front page.

The world's richest man has threatened to
pull the plug on hundreds of Scottish jobs.

Microsoft boss Bill Gates is furious over
raids on an East Kibride company that have
cost his computer firm millions of pounds.
    The American giants have slapped a
£500,000 "fine" on printing firm
Thomson Litho after the theft of 115,000
authenticity certificates for Microsoft
products.
    Thomson executives were so worried that
deputy chairman Gary Thomson flew to America
to plead with Microsoft - their biggest
client - not to withdraw their contract.
    But Gates said: "This is no bluff, we're
ready to pull the plug and Scotland will
suffer."
    Thomson plants in East Kilbride employ
more than 500 people. They have now been
hit twice by thieves.
    The first raid, last November, saw three
armed men burst into the factory - tie up
guards - and escape with a van full of CDs.
    The most recent raid saw authenticity
certificates stolen. These can turn pirate
copies into legitimate-looking products.

    RAIDS

Company hosses and police believe the raids
are the work of insiders.
  Gary Thomson said today: "The only people
I can trust in here are those who were on
holiday at the time of the last raid.
  "We want the stolen certificates back,
and to find the internal mole." Gary, who
jetted off to Washington to plead his firm's
case at a Microsoft board meeting, added: "We
were that close to losing our biggest client.
As a printing business we never realised just
how vulnerable we were to these hi-tech
criminals.
  "We convinced Microsoft that, as a firm,
we've wakened up to the threat facing us.

    BATTLE

"We have taken measures to ensure our security
matches that expected of us by the world's
leading computer software firm."
    The threat to Thomson's workers is just
the tip of the iceberg. More than 75,000 jobs
are involved in Scotland's Silicon Valley.
    Microsoft, whose Windows software is used
in 80 per cent of the world's desktops, has
admitted it's fighting a losing battle against
a computer mafia.
    The firm reckons it will lose £250m
through software pirates - a large proportion
of which will come from Scotland.
    And the crisis could jeopardise Scotland's
standing as a leading software centre - and
hinder hopes of further of inward investment.</pre>
