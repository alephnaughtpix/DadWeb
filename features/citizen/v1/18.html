    <h1>This edition has been disinfected before distribution!!!</h1>
    <p>If you're going to expect me to say "Cough!!! Cough!!!! Splutter!!! etc",
      then you're wrong!!!!!! I'm hardly coughing now!!!!! In fact, I should be
      really occasionally going "Bllleeeuuurggghhh!!!!" as that's what tends to happen
      now if I'm a bit too active!!!!!!! (Why are you looking at me like that!??!?!!)
      Well, at least I'm up and well enough to finish yet another brilliant issue
      of this fantastic brilliant (Oh no, I've already used the word "brilliant", and...
      Oh no!!!!! I've used "brilliant" again!!!!! Anyway... Oh phooey!!! I've used...
      OK, I'll stop it now!!!!!!!!!!!) Senior Citizen!!!!
    <p>Right!!!!! First thing- don't go to 
      <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> !!!! Why!?!?!?
      Because it doesn't work any more!!!!!!! See the story later in the issue... Use
      the Grelb addr or <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> , and we hope to have another
      snappy redirect addr soon!!!!</p>
    <p>Second!!!! I'm wanting your views on what's the best stories of the year!!!! If you've
      got an opinion, send it to us at 
      <a href="mailto://senior@forfree.at">mailto://senior@forfree.at</a> ... Or better still,
      if you're a member of the mailing list, why not send your suggestions to the list,
      and let's have a discussion?!?!?! So when you've finished this brilliant issue, why
      not have a look at the previous equally brilliant issues and suggest your fave
      stories?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Monolith gets broken!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now this is a bit of a bummer!!!!! The lovely site at 
    <a href="http://www.ml.org/">http://www.ml.org/</a> , where we got our 
    <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> 
    name from, are not going back online on Dec 5 as they promised!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="17.html#503"> issue 17</a>...) In fact, they're shutting down!!!!!! 
    Apparently they've run out of money or something lame like that.... So, luckily
    for us that <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> 
    has started working again!!! We're also looking for other redirect services...

  <h2>Barney- the anti-Christ!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Remember when we had a good laugh at those silly Americans for seeing sinister
    motivations behind the Teletubbies?!?!?! (See <a href="14.html#409"> issue 14</a>...)
    I made some flip comment about UK viewers seeing similar motives in Barney the
    Dinosaur!!!!!! Well, guess what I saw in an issue of the Scotsman today (24/11/98)!
    ??!?! Apparently, quite a few parents don't like Barney, and think it's an unsuitable
    role model for the kids!!!!! And the article mentions a lot about all the anti-Barney
    resources on tha netweb!!!!!</p>
  <p>Now, you would have thought that this article would have therefore been an obvious
    candidate for the Scotsman's online web edition, but no!!!! And there's not a trace
    of the story in <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/">http://www.scotsman.com/</a> !!!! 
    There isn't even a mention of it in the Scotsman's Yahoo News section in
    <a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/</a> !!!!! 
    Talk about missing the point!!!</p>

  <h2>A new Teletubby: 'Dipshit'!??!?!</h2>
  <p>This might be slightly old news to <b>Need To Know</b> readers, but I thought this
    was interesting, and worth mentioning before the BBC hear of it!!!!!!! I dunno
    who this "Dipshit" Teletubby is tho!!!</p>
  <p>Don't let any Americans view this site!!!! (See <a href="14.html#409"> issue

  <h2>'Get Down' and 'Boogie'- on tha NetWeb!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I was in Strathclyde University the weekend before last, "larging" it as they
    say!!! (And, yes, that's partly why the previous ish was a bit late!!!!) One
    of the things in the Union was this converted bar, which played "cheesy disco"
    all the time, so you had all these young whippersnappers with oblong-shaped
    "media" glasses dancing around really rather badly with "ironic" grins to tunes
    that are as old as the hills!!!!!!! What a brilliant and completely original
    idea!!!! OK, perhaps showing "South Park" on the video wall was perhaps taking
    things a bit too far, and I definately showed them up in the dancing stakes
    when Tight Fit's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" came on!!!!!!
    But apart from that, it was really "ironic" and "postmodern"!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>So I was pleased to hear of this rather fabby idea!!!!!!! An Internet Radio
    show devoted to cheesy disco!!!!!! OK, the website looks a little like a
    Realaudio-encoded Sinclair Spectrum display, but it's a great idea for a netweb
    siteweb!!!! You'll need to start wearing rectangular-shaped glasses, and grow
    a goatee beard before listening to it tho!!!!!</p>

  <h2>What on earth's happened to Yell.co.uk?!?!?</h2>
  <p>I saw of mention of <b>Yellow Pages</b> UK site re-design in the very nice
    <a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a> with some comment along
    the lines of it being really bad!!!!!! We thought: <i>"It's can't possibly
    be worse than it was before!!!!!"</i> We saw the initial page and it wasn't
    too bad... then we saw the rest of the site, and it was a flippin' bomb-site,
    that looks as though it was designed by a 7 year-old!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>What are you trying to do, Yell.co.uk!?!?!? Are you trying to get a "Muddy" 
    for your webby-sitey?!?!? (See <a href="5.html#149"> issue 5</a>...)</p>

  <h2>Go Bananas- literally!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, we like fruit at SDHQ!!!!! Full of Vitamins C and D, and marrowbone
    jelly!!!!!!!!!! So we were really pleased to learn about this site, which
    just talks about fruit all the time!!!!!!!! <b>Chuck's Produce Talk</b> is
    really a neat-o site!!!! We especially like the speedily rotating fruit icons!!!!!!
    Visit it, before someone else "pips" you to it!!!!!!!!!! (DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Be a Hollywood Prodigy!!!!!!!!</h2> 
  <p>If you want to see what people are saying about the big filmz (!!!) that
    are happening over in the US over the pond, then you might be interested
    in this webby-sitey!!!!! It's one of those new generation of funny little
    news sites like Slashdot and Newstrolls, where most of the stuff is written
    by the regular readers rather than an editorial team... Only in this case,
    it's movie reviews that are written!!!!!!!! It's a bit like the reviews
    part of <b>Ain't It Cool News</b>, only you don't have any introductions by
    Harry Knowles saying how cool he thinks it is!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Only one problem tho- the people behind this site are obviously fans of the
    Prodigy, as they've decided to call the site "<b>Hollywood Bitchslap</b>"!!!!
    We expect the Beastie Boys will be emailing them about this!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Countdown- without Carol Vorderman!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever been surfing on the supey-dupey infopipe highway web, and thought
    to yourself: <i>"Wouldn't it be really handy if I could keep tabs on how long
    there is to go before the Earth is engulfed in a cataclysmic nuclear conflict!!!!"</i>?!?!?! 
    Well, now you can find out!!!!! This very useful site keeps clocks on various
    deadlines, such as the Linux Y2.038K bug, and the "Doomday Clock"!!!!! I dunno
    how they measure the Doomday Clock tho!!!! Do they call the US Pentagon and
    say <i>"When are you going to start the nuclear war then!??!?!?"</i>!??!?!? 
    And do the Pentagon say: "Oh we've pencilled it in
    for a Wednesday in March 2132, but keep it quiet, will you!!!!!!!!!"</p>

  <h2>Countdown- WITH Carol Vorderman!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Right then Carol, here's some figures for you... 4, 1, 5, 25, 8, 19 !!!! Now,
    you have 30 seconds to use those numbers to make... 5 million!!!! What??!?!!?
    You've already got 5 million already!??!?! Oh... "shengis"!!!! (As we say in
    Scotland!!!!) <i>(Patronising Richard Whitely voice...) "You're really very
    clever for a woman, aren't you!!!!!"</i> etc. etc. ...

  <h2>You can't spell it- but you CAN surf tha W3 with it!!!!!</h2>
  <p>No doubt, you're 
    probably absolutely sick of hearing the news that your Netscape browsey-wowsey 
    has become an AOL browsey-wowsey!!!!! (You'll probably now be getting 
    "Free!!!! 1 month on AOL!!!! Give us your credit details please in case 
    we decide to take money off you!!!!!" disks hanging of the browser now!!!!!!) 
    Quite a few "Slashdot" type people are thinking about moving to a different 
    browsey-wowsey from the "big two"... We've already mentioned the latest 
    version of Opera recently, (See <a href="17.html#517"> issue 17</a>...) 
    but here's one for all you Linux geek-nerd propellor-head Star Wars 
    fans!!!!!! It's called "Mnmemnomnic", apparently because it's "modular" 
    or something...</p>
  <p>I think they ought to call it different name tho, as Mnmenmomninc is a really
    difficult name to spell!!!!! If they're reading I suggest that instead of
    Mnmemnmnemnmnonmnic (Damn!!!!!), they call it "<b>FLiB</b>", which is short
    for "<b>F</b>abby <b>Li</b>nux <b>B</b>rowsey-wowsey"!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Universal Translator- for computers!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You know that spiffy little object in those "Star Trek" stories called a
    "universal translator", which translates any language into the language you
    hear!?!?!! (Erm, hang on!!! How come it knows what language you speak!??!!?
    And how come you hear the translation from your translator, but not from
    anyone elses?!?!?!? If you ask me, that Bable Fish is a much more sensible
    idea!!!! Erm, where was I!??!?!) Oh yes, they're developing something called
    a "universal computing language", which is like a universal language which,
    erm, works on all computers... So, er, how is this different from Java
    then!??!?!</p>

  <h2>Read tha w3- on a 'pad'!!!!</h2>
  <p>You know when some young people say they're going back to their "pad",
    they're usually referring to some indoor rubbish dump with "Trainspotting"
    posters in it that they "hang out" in?!??! Well, if this lot here invite you
    back to their "pad", they'll not mean this at all!!!!! In fact, they'll probably
    want to "digitise" you and stick you into a "Master Control Program" to play
    "games", just like in "<b>Tron</b>"!!!!!!! That's because this "pad" is
    actually a computer!!!!!!! It's some snazzy palm base computer that can
    apparently surf tha netweb or something.</p>

    to this wonderful little wonder of technology!!!!! (No, not *<b>that</b>*

  <h2>Put another MP3 on the jukebox, baby!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Erm, actually, this story doesn't really have anything to do with Joan Jett,
    rock 'n' roll, or jukeboxes, really!!!!! But it *<b>does</b>* have something
    to do with MP3s!!!!! And it's a good headline as well!!!! So, yah boo sucks, and
    erm anyway!!!! It seems a "big" week for MP3s, I even saw them get a mention on
    Breakfast telly today!!!!!! Anyway, you know those people, slightly younger than
    me, that spend zillions on a really "sound" (Doh!!!) hi-fi system with loadsa
    sad things like gold-plated plugs for "proper connection" and a funny anti-static
    "zap gun" for gramophones!!??! Well, you can now have a really good laugh as they
    buy an MP3 Player "component" for their hi-fi system, as this lot have started
    making them!!!!!</p>
  <p>What do you mean, "what's funny about that"?!?!?! Well, despite
    what the people on Breakfast Telly might say, MP3s, due to their "lossy"
    compression are not really "CD quality" at all, especially if they're made from
    a "grungy" old analogue recording, as I found out when I tried to MP3 my
    Napalm Death collection!!!!! So in future, you'll be able to take a Jesus & Mary
    Chain MP3 along to your friend, and when it's played on the MP3 player, and comes
    out sounding like a wonky cassette recording, you can really cheese him or her
    off by saying: "Erm, that's not really very good sound quality, is it?!?!??!?!"!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>This story's not about MP3- say IUMA!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, here's an 
    internet music story that's also a non-MP3 story, amazingly enough!!!! 
    At least, it's a non-MP3 story, according to the <b>Internet Underground 
    Music Archive</b>, a really old internet site devoted to exposing (Oooh 
    blimey missus!!!!!!) new musical talent, who have done a rather big 
    report on the affect the Internet will have on music!!!!! No, they don't 
    say that music on the Internet makes you more depressed!!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="8.html#239"> issue 8</a>...) In fact, they say the internetty 
    webby thingy will revolutionise the way music is distributed- which 
    by an interesting coincidence, would make IUMA a major player, as they, 
    well, distribute music on the Internet!!!!!! 
  <p>But that's not all!!!! Apparently, MP3 is *<b>not</b>* going to be the major
    format used on the Internet!!!!!!! Which is jolly lucky for IUMA, as all the
    the full length songs in their archives appear to be in Realaudio or Liquid Audio
    format!!!!!!

  <h2>Radio East Milton!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, for us, the real find of the fortnight has been <b>Imagine Radio</b>, who
    are an Internet Radio station with a bit of difference!!!!!! They've got
    together with a whole load of various different types of radio stations, and
    pooled all their playlists together to create a mega-playlist of zillions of
    styles!!!!! So bleepin' what you might think, but the really smart thing is
    that you can register your own free account with them, and have your own
    internet radio station with a customised playlist made up from the
    mega-playlist!!! You can choose general genres from the various radio
    stations, but you can also go down to a more detailed level, and select/deselect
    individual artists in your personal playlists!!!!! Even better, you can make
    your customised station public, and let others listen to it!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>The Realaudio soundquality is pretty AM-like, but you actually get all of the
    song, and not just a clip of it!!!!! Sometimes, you even get the album or
    12-inch (Ooh-err crikey Vicar!!!) version of the song, rather than the
    "radio edit"!!!! (Isn't that ironic!!!) All that's missing now is having an
    automatic smartarse DJ blabbering all over the end of each record, and
    custom cheesy radio jingles!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.imagineradio.com/">http://www.imagineradio.com/</a></p>
  <p>Well, as you might guess, us Senior Dads like being on the cutting edge of
    technology, so we've started our own station!!!!! Yes!!!!!! The Senior Dads
    own Internet Radio Station, <b>Radio East Milton</b>, was launched at 5pm on
    25th November 1998!!!! Just as quiet as the Digital TV launch, but with
    better content!!!! If you've gotta mega-fast netty webby connection, listen
    to Radio East Milton!!! OK, most of you probably won't be able to listen to
    it, but you can go to the homepage, and find out what exciting records are
    played on our station!!!</p>

    whole theme park devoted to reggae <b>Bob Marley</b>!!! We don't know
    exactly what they've got planned for it, but expect they're be loads of
    "little birds" about the place, you'll be able to go on a rollercoaster
    called "The Wailers", you'll be able to get to get "Jammin" jam from the
    souvenier shop (Along with funny shaped cigarettes!!!!), and if you're a bloke 
    and you've got no woman with you, you'll
    not be allowed to cry!!!! We think there'll be "One Love" for this theme park, and there
    won't be any mass "Exodus" from it!!!! (DOH!!!!!!)</p>

    that's what this lot are working on!!!!!!! Moves are already being made for
    a web browser for the blind, (See <a href="13.html#375"> issue 13</a>...)
    but since a lot of websites use graphics, they're now working on a way to
    covert pictures to sound so that blind people can "hear" them!!! We expect
    as soon as the logo to this page is scanned, it'll give out a lot of happy
    noises!!!!! What happens when a piccy of Billie is scanned 
    tho?!?!?! Will it play "Because We Want To", and make the blind people

    (See <a href="7.html#200"> issue 7</a>...) We're really talking a new radio
    "band", brought to you by satellite!!!! "<i>In your car radio, you'll have
    AM, FM, and XM,</i>", say some person in the following story... </p>

  <h2>Shopping: 'Resistance is Futile'!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what the Borg do when they have to do the
    shopping?!?!?! Well, according to this lot, you'll be able to find out!!!!!
    Because they're working out how to add wearable computers to the shopping
    experience!!!! Tho we think this might backfire on the shops!!!!! I mean, if
    all this stuff we've been hearing in the past couple of weeks about
    supermarkets in UK being really naughty to everyone and taking all the money
    for themselves, who knows what may happen!!!! The shoppers may suddenly
    decide to "assimilate" them!!!!! </p>
  <p>(Interestingly this story comes from the <b>Las Vegas Sun</b>!!!! We were expecting them
    to blame it all on the Germans and French, but to our surprise, they didn't!!! We didn't
    see any "Page 3" either!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>That 'portal' is kids stuff- literally!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, now we know that this flippin' cliched "portal" business has finally
    hit the bottom of it's nadir, all by itself!!!!!! And here's the evidence!!!!!!
    Some 11 year-old has started a portal service, and is becoming reasonably
    successful with it, and this story gives a "little whizzkid really really
    shows it to the grow-ups!!" spin!!!!! </p>
  <p>The thing is, if the average kid can run a successful portal, then what's
    so flippin' special about the "big" portals run by massive companies?!?!?!?!?! We
    say, well done to the 11 year old for cutting through all this flippin'
    "portal" hype!!!! </p>

  <h2>Pointcast- in the UK!!!!</h2>
  <p>One interesting idea that we thought was a bit ahead of it's time was this
    <b>Push Media</b> business that was being hyped a year or two ago!!!! Unlike
    the "portal" business, we thought it was a bit better!!!!! Generally, what
    happens is that you call a "push" provider, and download the latest webpages
    from your favourite "channels", and you can read them offline!!! So you
    could, for example, get all the news from your favourite daily news websites
    automatically, and make up your own customised offline internet "newspaper"!!!!
    Unfortunately, despite some good push stuff, and even some hype from Micosoft,
    with their "Active Channels" stuff in IE, there were loads of competing
    proprietary standards, and the "best thing since slice bread" style hype didn't exactly
    do any favours either!!!!</p>
  <p>Anyway, one of the good ones was <b>Pointcast</b>, which allowed users to make their
    own channels!!!! The main prob with it was that the choice of "proper" channels was a
    bit US biased to say the least!!!!! Until now!!!! Or soon anyway!!!! Pointcast are
    now putting together a UK versh!!!!</p>

  <h2>Give yourself a Zing?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, it's been some time since we mentioned that other spiffy push invention, <b>Zing!</b>!!!! 
    (See <a href="10.html#312"> issue 10</a>...) The idea of viewing spiffy 
    animated bits whilst you're loading a webpage, and loading the animations 
    whilst you're not "doing" anything on the net is a still really great 
    idea, but apart from the increasingly "fnarr fnarr!!!!" French language 
    serial, (See <a href="13.html#387"> issue 13</a>...) the content provided 
    by the Zing! channels is still pretty duffo to say the least!!!!!! But 
    one thing has changed!!!! We said before that if Zing! allowed users 
    to create their own content, then things would improve rapidly- and 
    they've done it!!!!! Well, almost!!!!! Users can create their own Zing! 
    channel with JPEGs and/or Shockwave Flash anims either form the web, 
    or their own HD!!!!!</p>
  <p>Only one prob- unlike Pointcast's user channels, which allows users to put their
    channels on tha w3 for other users to download into the viewer, and always checks
    for updated content or channel data on the net, the Zing! channel only remains on
    the users HD as a part of some config textfile!!! If we wanted to broadcast our
    own Senior Dads Zing! channel, we'd have to take the bit of the config file with
    our stuff on it, and tell viewers to cut and paste it into their own config
    file!!!!! Not very user-friendly, eh?!?!?! And there's no way to telling the
    channel to update, short of telling the user to select "Update now" from the menu
    every so often!!!!</p>
  <p>So, it'll take a bit more updating in program terms before Zing! really becomes
    a hit, we think!!! But they're moving in the right direction!!!!</p>

  <h2>Move over Linux- here's Trinux!!!</h2>
  <p>A few more of our reader peeps probably have stuck Linux on one of their old
    computers by now, so here's a new one for you!!!! <b>Trinux</b> is like Linux- only
    smaller!!!! It fits on 3 flopy disks, and says in RAM all the time, just like an old
    Amiga 500 system!!!! Apparently this is really handy for portable systems or something
    like that!!!!</p>

  <p>Looks like that that spiffy Ion rocket we talked about before, (See <a href="17.html#510"> 
    issue 17</a>...) the one started off working really well, then a very

  <h2>Billboards- for little green men!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, if there's one surefire way to test for an alien civilisation of advanced
    intelligence, it's to see if they "switch over" when the ads come on!!!! So,
    this is a really clever idea!!!!! The space agency dudes are seriously considering
    selling ad space on the side of a spaceship to Mars!!!!! So if those microbes
    they found in that rock thingy ever evolve into an intelligent lifeform, they'll
    be know where to get their Coca-Cola, or something like that!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Bet Reagan's really pleased now!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember that old bloke in the Whitehouse not so long ago!!! The delightful old
    movie actor one that soaid such great things like "Where would this land be without
    this great country of ours!??!?" and "The bombing begins in 5 minutes!!!"?!?!?!
    Yes, I'm of course, referring to Ronald Reagan!!!!! One of his great ideas at the
    time was this thingy called "Star Wars", which apparently had nothing at all to
    do with the film, but was about zapping satellites and missile with big laser
    guns and stuff!!!!! A lot of people for some reason found this idea extremely
    funny!!!!! But the really funny thing is that according to this story, by the
    time the next "Star Wars" comes out, the Chinese might have a laser weapon to zap
    out satellites!!!!!</p>

    We've managed to get listed in their directory, despite us questioning 
    the logic of their organising a convention for onlien zines in a completely 
    non-online setting!!!!!! Mind you, they also listed <b>Need To Know</b>, 
    who really slagged the conference off!!!!! What's really funny is that

  <h2>3D camera- with a 3D flash!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now this is a bit interesting... This is one of those funny cameras that can
    "do" 3D images!!!! Usually tho, the cameras need more than one lens, so it
    can, erm, "do" a 3D image!!!!! This one's a bit different tho- it uses a
    funny flash using lights of different frequencies, and measures the different
    frequencies and works out from that how to "do" a 3D piccy!!!!!</p>

  <h2>'Ambient House' fans- read this!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, seeing how the 80s are suddenly back in fashion and everyone's pretending
    that they really liked Culture Club and A Flock of Seagulls all along, it
    obviously won't be too long before the early 90s are back in fashion!!!!!! So
    why not get their before anyone else by visiting this site, which is all about
    one of the classic early 90s fashion statements- the fractal thingy!!!! Yes,
    with "<b>Sprott's Fractal Gallery</b>", you can remember the times when all those
    "Mandlebrots" and "Julias" were staring out from the cover of zillions of
    "Ambient House" compilations!!!! In fact, you can even re-create the sound as
    well, because the website also features random "fractal" MIDI music on the
    pages!!! Now, all that's left is for the webmaster to call himself "Juan" or
    something.</p>
