    <h1>If you read this issue (Your life will be better)!!!!!</h1>
    <p>I'm writing this little bit on tha Fri 13th!!!!!!!!! Woo!!!! I
      thought all that guff about it being unlucky was, erm, guff!!!! But when I
      was on that little NT course that I'm on, all of the NT computers refused to
      work properly!!!!! And then I decided to take an afternoon nap, and when I
      woke up, it was late and every one had gone home!!!!! And I hadn't even
      finished this issue!!!! So after about an hour spent getting my disk out of
      the funny disk drive on the computer, I let myself out of the room, and then
      got stopped by the security people, and had to spend an inordinate amount
      of time explaining why I wasn't a burglar!!!!! Then I ran to the bus stop,
      and found I'd missed the bus!!!!!!! Then the second bus got hit by a
      meteorite!!!!! So I had to walk home!!!!!!!! I've just arrived, and there's
      only 5 more minutes of this day to go, so at least not much can go wrong
      now!!! so, without furTHER ADO, HERE'S THE NEXT ISSUE OF sENIOR cITIZEN...
      Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Bet their 'bedside manner' is pretty bad as well!!!!! (Ooh-err!!!)</h2>
  <p>What's on the web and quacks!??!?!?! Well, according to this news story,
    some doctors!!!! A lot of "proper" doctors have come to the surprising
    conclusion that some "cyberdoc" wesbites are run by quacks, and have warned
    that they might get it wrong!!!!!! For example one "doc" recommended 'two
    bowel movements', whilst another suggested 'Red Clover and Dandelion', which
    was oddly enough available from the "Doc" at a small cost!!!!! One even
    suggested 'two apples a day', which is really stupid, since as everyone
    knows, "an apple a day...", so two apples is like a polite way of telling
    your patient to "rack off"!!!!! (As they say in those Australian soaps!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>What a Webby, er, cache!!!!</h2>
  <p>When you set the cache size on your web browsey-wowsey, do you set it to a
    couple of megs!?!?! Well, maybe in the future, you'll be like this lot, and
    set it to a couple of million megs!!!! The UKs largest web cache has just
    opened to help ISPs store web pages frequently accessed by their users, and
    it can store a terabyte of data!!!!!!! One of the people behind this seems
    really enthusiastic about it: <i>"A terabyte represents an incredible amount
    of storage. For instance, if a book were to contain the same amount of
    information, it would be 32,000 feet high - taller than Mount Everest,"</i>!!!!!</p>
    <p>Wow!!!!!!!!!! That must be enough for about a couple of weeks worth of
      "jazz" and "appz" for UK users!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Sing like an idiot!!!!! On tha blower!!!</h2>
  <p>What do you usually 
    do when you get on tha blower to tha "old man"?!?!?!?! Do you say: "Allo 
    me old muckah!!!! It's good to taaawwwlk!!!!!"?!?!?! Or do you sing 
    down the phone: "I am the telephone operator!!! (Beep!!! Beep!!!)" in 
    a German accent?!?!?!! Well, if it's the latter, then this might be 
    for you!!!!! Because technology has now reached it's pinnacle of excellence!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Well.......... maybe not, but this is a great milestone around the necks 
    of technology!!!!!! Karaoke on tha phonnnee!!!!!!!! But this is not 
    any karaoke!!!! This one has 20,000 chunky chunes in it!!!!! That means 
    it's probably one of the few online services that actually has Clive 
    Dunn's "Grandad" in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Great balls of fire!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, when Jerry Lewis was singing "Great Balls of Fire" (!!!!! Ooh-er!!!!!!!!!!!)
    I bet you didn't know it was about the potential for an explosive
    chain-reaction due to overabundance of helium resulting from a hydrogen-rich
    nuclear fusion reaction on a stellar scale!!!!!! Well, look at this
    impressive piccy and see if you can't see what the great ragtime 50s rocker
    was going on about!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>A 'Beano' for young lawyers!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Well, as they 
    keep saying, "Only In America!!!!" And one thing that's really popular 
    only in America is suing the "ass" off people whom cause you "traumatic 
    distress" (ie you disagree with them!!!!)!!!!! So instead of young people 
    wanting to grow up and be an atomic physicist, or writer of ITV situation 
    comedy, they're wanting to be a lawyer!!!!!!!! Or at least, this lot 
    are!!!!!!!!!!!! They're called <b>Future Lawyers Alliance Network (FLAN)</b>!!!!!! 
    So, have a look here at their highly entertaining newsletter, and get 
    the "FLAN" in your face!!!! (Doh!!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>It's cool for Katz!!!!! (DOH!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>After Jon Katz 
    stopped writing for Hotwired, (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</A>...) 
    we thought we wouldn't see too much of him after that, but the opposite 
    has happened!!!!!!! In fact, a whole load of sites we visit regularly 
    now have Jon Katz columns!!!!! First, there was the Freedom Forum site, 
    then the Newstrolls column (See <a href="11.html#321"> issue 11</A>...) 
    .... Now he's on Slashdot!!! It started when he did some column on the 
    Freedom Forum site about Slashdot publicising the MS "Halloween Memo" 
    (See <a href="15.html#449"> issue 15</A>...) ...</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/technology/1998/11/6katz.asp">http://www.freedomforum.org/technology/1998/11/6katz.asp</a></p>
  <p>Slashdot linked to this, and all the usual geek propellor-head nerds 
    slagged Katz off for getting some technical thingies wrong, so he 
    was invited to do an "upgraded version" for Slashdot!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/09/1124251.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/98/11/09/1124251.shtml</a></p>
  <p>But near the end of this week, <i>another</i> column by Katz appeared!!!! 
    Is this going to be a regular thing, we wonder?!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>You'll need 'foresight' to see it!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, it's been 
    a bit too long since we mentioned really small objects!!!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="13.html#401"> issue 13</A>...) So here's a group that's all 
    about nanotechnology!!!!! They're called the "<b>Foresight Institute</b>", 
    proably because you'll need a lot of foresight (In both eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
    in order to be able to see the tiny nanotechhy thingies!!!! Even if 
    you're not into technology, you mgith be interested in this, if you're 
    into "old skool" demos, you'll like this site, as the illustrations 
    for "nanomachines" look like old "vectorball" demos!!!!

  <h2>Tom Snyder- stop ripping us off!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Over here, we 
    had Wogan, but in the US, there are a whole load of talk show hosts 
    who pretend like they're really funny or something!!!! In fact, I saw 
    one last night on my new fangled cable box called "David Letterman", 
    who was really terrible!!!!!! (I'm talking about the talk show, you 
    idiots!!! Not the cable box!!!!!!!!!! Calling a cable box "David Letterman" 
    would be really stupid!!!!!! Unless it was really unfunny!!!!!!) And 
    according to this article, a lot of the really unfunny "monologue" stuff 
    in last week's talk shows was ripped right off the Internet!!! But look 
    at the end bit... Now look at the headline on our last issue!!!! (See 
    <a href="15.html#"> issue 15</A>...) We know you're reading this, Tom, 
    so read this- stop ripping us off!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Come the nuclear halocaust- you still can play Tetris!!! (And evade the 
    KGB!!!)</h2>
  <p>If you're worried 
    about all thos security forces tapping into your computer using funny 
    rays or whatever they use, then you might like this little laptop from 
    Wang!!!! It's got this spiffy technology called <b>Tempest</b>, which 
    of course is named after the populat text editing program on the Atari!!!!!!! 
    It can stop people with funny technology eavesdropping on your machine!!! 
    And it can even protect against an electromagnetic pulse damaging your 
    equipement, so if any Johnny Foreigner gets bored with attempting to 
    spy on your computer, and instead just lobs an atomic bomb in your vague 
    direction, the massive electromagnetic pulse caused by zillions of atoms 
    engaging in an atomic chain-reaction will not zilch out your compute!!!! 
    (Well, unless of course, they just land a bomb *<b>on</b>* the compute!!!! 
    I don't think Tempest can quite protect against that!!!!!!)</p>
  <p>As Scotty might say: "It cannae go W(r)ang!!!!" (Doh!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Guardian says- sell your MS shares!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this rather 
    surprising article comes from the UK broadsheet newspaper for what you 
    American people call "liberals"!!!!!!!! It's actually yet another of 
    the "in-depth" pieces that came about as a result of the extremely slow 
    reaction of the mainstream media to the MS "Halloween Memo", (See <a href="15.html#449"> 
    issue 15</A>...) but the closing sentence is a bit of a surprise: <i>"If 
    you have Microsoft shares, prepare to sell them now"</i>!!!!!! Wow!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Well, it might 
    be a few months away from us, but we're already gearing up for it!!!!!! 
    No, we're not talking about Xmas!!!!!!! We're really talking about the 
    new Star Wars film!!!!!! They've already started the posters for it!!!!! 
    Notice tho- the film is supposed to be called "Star Wars: The Phantom 
    Menace", but look here- it's called "Episode 1" in the poster!!! Erm....</p>

    month (And then we charge you!!!!)" type disks from AOL hanging off 
    it?!?!?!? Well, according to this survey, you are smiling and doing 
    a little happy dance!!!!!!!! According to this survey AOL users are

    but it's wireless computing time again!!!!! And now, there's an official 
    industry standard for communication between computes and radiograms!!! 
    So soon you'll be able to communicate with your computer by carefully

  <h2>Go to a conference- literally (Not!!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Conferences are 
    really boring arent't they?!?!??!? I mean, you have to travel halfway 
    across the country, to some really boring conference and then sit around 
    and listen to people talk bollox or look at a whole load of really boring 
    stands at an exhibition!!! Well, there's one conference happening as 
    you read this, where you can listen to people talking bollox and view 
    really boring stands in an exhibition- without moving from your house!!!!! 
    That's because <b>Avatars 98</b> is a *<b>virtual reality</b>* conference!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16192.html">http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16192.html</a></p>
  <p>It's probably not the very first "virtual" conference ever as is 
    claimed here- for example there was an Atari convention (ICC 3) a 
    couple of years ago that took place entirely on the internet using 
    websites, IRC and email, but this is one of the first high profile 
    conferences we've heard of that takes place entirely in various VRML 
    venues!!!!! Perhaps we ought to try this out for a future Senior Dads 
    coding covention!??!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Talk about missing the point!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, perhaps 
    this next lot might take notice!!!!!!!! At the same time as Avatars 
    98, a conference called <b>Webzine 98</b> is taking place!!!!! As soon 
    as I heard of it, I though "Aha!!!! Webzines!!!!! It must be online 
    then!!!!! I'll be able to advertise my esteemed organ on it!!!! (By 
    which I of course mean "Senior Citizen", you dirty minded people!!!!!!!!) 
    Then I went to the website, and I find out that... It's not online 
    at all!!!!! It's taking place in San flippin' Francisco!!!!!!!! Talk 
    about missing the flippin' point!!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p>And the website isn't exactly the world's best design either!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Flash Gordon- almost!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember in the 
    old days during the summer holidays when the BBC always used to put 
    programs on in the morning for children like "Why Don't You...? (Just 
    Switch Off Your Television And Go Out And Do Something Less Boring Instead?!?!?)" 
    (Which I always did at that point, because it was a really boring programme!!!!!) 
    and one of those "cliff-hanger serials" with "Buster" Crabbe in them, 
    usually playing Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers!!!!! (And I bet you thought 
    that part was invented by Glen A Larson!!!!!!!) And at the same time, 
    there was this sci-fi comic strip series in the Daily Record (See <a href="15.html#456"> 
    issue 15</A>...) called "Lance McLaine" which was exactly 3 pictures 
    long every day, and made absolutely no sense whatsoever!!!! Well, now 
    you relive those times with this website, which serves up a daily sci-fi 
    adventure- and just in case it doesn't make any sense, you can check

  <p>There are quite 
    a few things you might expect from Comdex, one of the world's biggest

    wearing the various components of a Gnome!!!!!!! If you think that's 
    weird, how about thos ewho wear the various constituent parts of a Gimp!??!?! 
    Or even an Apache?!?!?!? As some of you slightly speedier readers might 
    have guessed by now, this is because some company are going to debut 
    a wearable Linux computer!!!! So you'll be able to run Gnome, Gimp, 
    Apache or whatever on a computer that's a little easier to carry around 
    than my current Linux box, <b>"Godzilla"</b>!!!! And it'll probably 
    crash a lot less than my Windows 95 box, <b>"James Dean"</b>!!!!!

  <h2>Memory controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation

    <p>What do you mean, 
      "What's a 'Memory controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure 
      of speculation on the physical nature of a component being addressed'?!?!?!?" 
      Well, erm, I don't know really, but it's one of the first actual proper 
      things that have com out of the world's most hyped company ever, *<b>Transmeta</b>*!!!!!! 
      The company, run by Paul Allen, who along with Bill Gates, founded Microsoft, 
      and which also employs Linus Torvalds (Yep!! Mr Linux!!!!), has been 
      very very secretive about what's it's actually doing, so this patent 
      that it's filed for a "Memory controller for a microprocessor for detecting 
      a failure of speculation on the physical nature of a component being 
      addressed" is something interesting!!!!!!!!! I'm not exactly sure what 
      it does, but you can be sure that this time next year, the phrase "Memory 
      controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation 
      on the physical nature of a component being addressed" will be on everyone's 
      lips!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>According to this

    still a lot like "Killer Net"!!!! Only, unlike most people, they're 
    taking "Killer Net" seriously, and not as the corking parody of bad 
    "Net" programmes that it really is!!!!! Apparently they think tha mighty

    you'll like this!!!!!!!! Some really clever person has noticed that 
    in a lot of webby articles that a lot of the right-hand margin tends 
    to be blank, so this person thought- "Aha!!!! A space for adverts!!!!" 
    And so he worked out how to do it on spiffy modern web browsers!!!!!! 
    Bet you can't wait, eh?!?!?!?!?!</p>
