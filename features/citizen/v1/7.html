    <h1>The magazine equivalent of 'Saving Private Ryan'!!!!</h1>
    <p>I've been doing a little "promoting" 
      of <b>Senior Citizen</b> recently!!! I've recently got it added to John 
      Labovitz's Ezine Directory, (See <a href="3.html#63"> issue 3</a>...) and 
      submitting it to loads of search engines... One little effect of this is 
      that I've got the zine onto the Umich Etext Archives in it's own little 
      directory!!!! So you can now get back issue of the email edition of Senior 
      Citizen at: </p>
      <p><a href="ftp://etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Zines/Senior_Citizen/">ftp://etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Zines/Senior_Citizen/</a></p>
      <p>And we've got own little archive on the main SD website at:</p>
      <p><a href="ezine/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/features/citizen/ezine/</a></p>
      <p>So all you new readers don't need to miss out!!!!</p>

  <h2>Hear voices in your head- thanks to Bandaii and Hasbro!!!!</h2>
  <p>The guys from 
    Bandaii and Hasbro (Who are taking a bit of a break from buying things 
    with "Falcons" in them (See <a href="5.html#158"> issue 5</a>...) !!!!) 
    have come up with an, erm, interesting new idea!!! How does this grab 
    you.... You get a lollipop, right, and you stick in this "holder" thingy, 
    which contains recordings of various sound efffects... And the holder 
    takes the sound data, and vibrates the lolly, so that you get all the 
    sounds in your head!!!!!!! Well, a lot of people seem to like the idea 
    anyway!!!! If you're a regular reader, (See <a href="6.html#174"> issue 
    6</a>...) you'll probably say it's "Technical yummy"- literally!!!</p>

  <p><b>Note (Thu 27 Aug)</b>- UK TV Telextext magazine <b>Digitiser</b> has
    picked up on the story, and they did the "voices in the head" joke as well!!!</p>

  <h2>NT bods- You still need to watch your orifice!!!</h2>
  <p>Apparently those progs to defeat that NT hacking program 
    <b>"Back Orifice"</b> are not very good!!! Apparently you just 
    need to fiddle about with the settings on Back Orifice and 
    it'll defeat the two main anti-Back Orifice proggies!!!</p>
  <p>BTW Oddly enough, someone in the old folks home has just noticed 
    about this Back Orifice lark after it was written up in a little 
    feature in the Mail on Sunday!!! Apparently they were going on 
    about it like it was a virus or something!!!!</p>

  <h2>I had a good headline for this, but I forgot it!!!</h2>
  <p>Apparently some scientests have discovered how the brain actually 
    remembers things!!!! Some person called "Rugg" in Scotland worked this 
    out, but that's all I can remember about him!!! I had to write this 
    down before I forgot it...</p>

  <h2>Digital Paper!!! (Erm, looks familiar!!!)</h2>
  <p>Wow!!! Rank Xerox have done it again!!!! They've made electronic 
    displays as thin as very thick paper!!!! Isn't that amazing!!!! Erm, 
    hang on, didn't we already cover this before!?!? Yes, we did!! In 
    one of the early issues as well!!!! (See <a href="2.html#49"> issue 
    2</a>...) But these slowcoaches in the "old" media have just caught 
    up with it!!!!</p>

  <h2>That supercomputer network's rubbish!!!</h2>
  <p>We've already covered the boat made out of rubbish, (See <a href="6.html#167"> issue 
    6</a>...) but how about computers made up out of old bits chucked out 
    of PCs?!?! Well, people with Linux boxes already know about that as 
    a lot of people with Linux boxes have made them out of the old out-of-date 
    parts that can't run the lastest software on their current Wintel PCs!!! 
    Well, someone's taken it to another level by linking a whole lot of 
    them together in a "Beowulf" network!!!! What *that* is I do not know, 
    but it's supposed to be big anyway, so it's impressive that they can 
    do it with old bits of computers!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/facilities/beowulf/">http://www.esd.ornl.gov/facilities/beowulf/</a></p>
  <p>But a team in Holland have gone one better!!!! They've actually made a
    supercomputer out of *<b>BROKEN</b>* parts!!!!! You might wonder how the hell the
    flippin' thing can work at all, never mind racing along '100 times faster than a
    top-end workstation'!!!! Well, they're using loads of spiffy software as diagnostic
    tools to correct the errors in the broken parts!!! They're actually seriously
    going for a trillion instructions per second on this thing!!! So, it might be
    rubbish, but it's very fast rubbish!!!!</p>

  <h2>M-PEG Modules??!</h2>
  <p>This is pretty impressive!!! While I've been getting into MP3, I've 
    been keeping my ear on the ground to hear what's new in MPEG-land!!! 
    (Well, obviously I've not literally got my ear on the ground, as that 
    would be really silly wouldn't it!!!! No, I'm actually reading web 
    pages about it actually!!!!)</p>
  <p>Anyway, I was recently in a sort of "argument" with someone on <a href="news://alt.digitiser/">news://alt.digitiser/</a> 
    about General MIDI versus soundtracker modules for music. This guy 
    argued (pretty reasonably) that GM was portable between machines and 
    sounded good on a proper MIDI setup, whilst I argued that you didn't 
    have that much control over how GM sounds on a machine but on soundtracker 
    mods you have complete control within the (comparatively limited) format, 
    and they sound the same on all the machines. The only problem was there 
    there are a lot of different soundtracker formats and they vary from 
    platform to platform!!!! So what we really would need is a format that 
    has the portability of GM, but allows the complete control of sound 
    that you can get with soundtracker mods!!!!!</p>
  <p>Sounds a tall order?!?! Well say hello to <STRONG>MP4</STRONG>!!! It's pencilled
    in for proper "launch" later this year, but the specs are online, and audio-wise
    it looks like the ultimate format that soundtracker fans have been looking for!!!
    Don't confuse this with MP3 tho- it's as different as Cubase is to an old 8-track
    cartridge!!! You can play bits of sampled sound like in MP3, but you can also play
    "instruments" in a MIDI stylee, and add effects to them like reverb and so on...
    What's really interesting is that they're not just instruments of the sampled
    type- they can be "synthesised", and we're not talking about cheapo sounding
    synths here, we're talking about all the latest techniques used in the new keyboards
    like: vector synthesis, physical modelling, emulation of analogue and so on!!!
    Obviously the drawbacks here are that you'd need a bloody good processor to to do
    all this sort of stuff!!! The other prob I can see is that tracker progs using MP4
    would almost be as complex as MIDI progs, with loadsa special plugin progs to fully
    use the synthy bits!!! (eg 303 emulators, anyone?!?!)</p>
  <p>I've only just talked about the audio stuff, but the video bit of MP4 looks almost
    as good!!! Apparently you can make "synthetic people" to talk along with dialog, and
    plonk people in front of backgrounds and so on... Looks like a format you can make
    wacky video and audio with!!!! It'll probably kill your Pentium tho!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Einstien was wrong!!!!!!</h2>
  <p><i>"God does not play dice!"</i> So said brainy bloke Albert Einstien. 
    Mind you, he dated Marilyn Monroe for a bit, so he obviously couldn't 
    have been using his brain all the time!!!!!! So it's not too suprising 
    he got the odd thing wrong from time to time!!! Apparently scientests 
    have found that God actually *<b>does</b>* play dice!!! Well, not really 
    literally, obviously!!!!!! What they mean is that things happen randomly 
    in quantum physics which is a little different really!!!! Anyway, they've 
    found out why- apparently if there wasn't random things happening in 
    quantum physics, we'd be able to break the speed of light and really 
    muck up causality!!!!</p>

  <h2>Shall we bring out the Gimp (for Windows)!??!?!</h2>
  <p>If you've been in Linux for more than a few months, then no doubt you'll have 
    heard of <b>The Gimp</b>!!!! Nope, it's not a mysterious leather-clad Linux 
    and S&M enthusiast!!!! It's actually a free Photoshop clone for Linux!!! 
    (Gimp stands for "GNU Image Manipulation Program"!!!!) We've used it a 
    bit ourselves, and we can say it's one of the first real "killer apps" 
    we've seen on the Linux platform!!! And now someone's done a port for 
    Windows so all you Wintel fans can see how good it is!!! But not quite 
    yet, because it's in an early stage ATM!! But since it's a free prog 
    like the original Gimp, it'll means that less people will pirate Photoshop, 
    so it's quite a good thing of course!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.isl.net/~setera/gimp/gimpw32.html">http://www.isl.net/~setera/gimp/gimpw32.html</a></p>
  <p>And even Adobe are giving the Gimp a plug!!!! Read this letter from Adobe 
    about the likelihood of porting Photoshop to Linux... Generally they "Sorry, 
    not enough demand!!!! Why not try Gimp instead?!?!?!"</p>

  <h2>Track satellites!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever saw a small light zip across the sky, and thought "My!!! 
    I've seen a satellite!!! I wonder what that would look like in a 3D model 
    rendered by a Java program!??!?!" Well, now you can find out thanks to 
    NASA!!! They've done a 3D model of all satellites launched and you view 
    it in some sort of new fangled Java window, and do all the usual "virtual 
    reality" things like zoom and click around and so on... You can even do 
    a simulated time-lapse of their orbits and see them go around the Earth 
    very quickly, like a lot of midges!!!! So, coming from Scotland, I find 
    it quite reassuringly familiar!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Blinking computers!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember in the old days, computers in films and TV used to have loads of blinking 
    lights all over them!!?!? Well, those days might be long gone, but you 
    can recreate them with the <b>PulseBox</b>!!!! It's erm, a load of blinking 
    LEDs that flash in time with whatever your computer is doing!!!! They 
    actually tell you what you need and how to do in the link below, so you 
    can also be transported back to the days of <b>Hobby Electronic</b> magazine 
    as well!!!!! Only thing is you need the new-fangled BeOS to run it!!!! 
    (So no prob for Colostomy Bag, as he already has it!!!!) Mind you, I 
    can't wait for Glen Larson Sci-Fi TV Series Sound Effects Emulator tho!!!!!</p>

  <h2>PCs might have Y2.001K problem?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>This is a wierd one!!!! According to an Aussie Finiancial website, many PCs might 
    survive the year 2000 and instead completely trip up on the year 2001!!!!!! 
    In the URL below an MS guy says that some PC BIOS chips aren't really 
    Y2K complaint, but Windows can handle that!!! Unfortunately, it can't 
    handle it in 2001!!! Erm... So why didn't they fix it for 2001 then?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>All that technology just to do a radiogram!!!</h2>
  <p>According to the following article, someone's done a whole book based on
    Internet Radio stations!!! Apparently, there's more radio stations on the Internet
    than on radio!!!!! This is news to me!!!!! Mind you, apparently web radio doesn't
    come up very well in search engines!!!! But even when I find them, I can't seem to
    receive them. Mind you, that might be because I've got a 300 baud modem!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Old ST Farts to meet again in next millenium!!!!</h2>
  <p>Aaah!!! Now this 
    warms the cockles of my heart!!!!! Somewhere in Holland between thee 
    15th and 17th Dec 2000, there's going to be a 10th anniversary of the 
    first <b>ST News Christmas Coding Convention</b>!!! The organisers, 
    the former team of <b>ST News</b>, one of the best diskmags ever, intend 
    to get all the people from the original convention back together, as 
    well as others!!! This includes all those famous coders, graphists and 
    musicians from the boom times of the ST demo scene!!! So of course, 
    we're interested in going ourselves!!!! After all, we've managed to 
    get the Atari scene onto VH-1!!!! (See <a href="5.html#146"> issue 5</a>...) 
    So we must be pretty important as well!!!

  <h2>Even older computing farts!!!!</h2>
  <p>It may sound amazing, but there are people who have been in
    computing longer than I have!!!! Here's a story about the very
    first computer programmers... And they're all women!!! It seems
    that when they invented this new-fangled computer thingy, because
    it had a keyboard, the blokes gave the work to all the
    secretaries!!!! Now the women here are having the last laugh
    since they because they became the first computing geeks decades
    before loads of spotty little guys made it fashionable!!!!!</p>

    Well, I don't mean "booting" it literally, as you would damage the

  <h2>Scotland the Raw website back up again!!!</h2>
  <p>Now this is really wierd!!! Just as we were ready to give up on this 
    lot, they suddenly turn not to be dead after all!!!! Almost one month 
    after the debut issue appeared, and 3 weeks after both the websites 
    disappeared, the original website goes up again!! (Tues 25th Aug!!) 
    No explanation is given though, as the page put up at the old Gamerush 
    site URL is exactly the same as when it went down!!! We dunno if this 
    is some sort of subtle "Zen" publicity policy or what!!! But before 
    this latest development, over the past couple of weeks we're trying 
    to find out what on Earth happened to "Scotland the Raw" since the 
    two websites went down on Thu 8 Aug... (See <a href="5.html#163"> issue 
    5</a>...) </p>
  <p>We used loadsa websearches, we trawled the news using <b>Deja-News</b>-
    nothing!!!! Nada!!! Zippo!!! Seems no-one's heard of "Scotland the Raw"
    ezine on the Internet!!! (Except readers of this mag of course!!!!) The
    last thing we did before we jacked it in was to send an enquiry into a
    couple of Scottish-related newsgroups asking if anyone had heard of it,
    and knew what had happened to it!!! We sent a message to <a href="news://soc.culture.scottish/">news://soc.culture.scottish/</a>
    on Monday night, and got one of our friends who has access to local Scottish
    newsgroups sent a message of their own on Tuesday.... Then suddenly,
    on Tuesday the Gamerush webpage reappeared!!!! (Hmmmmm... What a strange
    coincidence!!!) At the time of writing though, the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a>
    address is still non-existant!!!</p>
  <p>Perhaps the re-appearance of the website, with it's contact email addr for
    subscriptions to the zine, is their subtle way of gearing up for a second issue?!?!?</p>

  <h2>Another naughty Scottish Maggy on tha webby!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, "Scotland The Raw" might have to watch out because there's 
    another Scottish satirical mag on tha W3!!! It's "Rogue Parcel" 
    (As in "such a parcel of rogues for a nation", from that Rabbie C 
    Burns poem "Such a parcel of rogues for a nation"!!!) and although 
    the site appears to have a bit of a strange idea as regards to web design, it's 
    actually quite good!! The articles and short and sharp and to the 
    point, the range of subjects covered is pretty varied, and the 
    writer/s appears to be completely cyncial about everything and are 
    pretty funny!!! (The editor also gives a really good email impersonation 
    of a tetchy old git!!!!) And they've done their second issue and are working 
    on their third!!!! So "Scotland The Raw" already has a bit of 
    serious competition!!!!</p>

  <h2>We get in Melody Maker!!!!</h2>
  <p>Yes, it's true!!! The popular young person's beat music weekly, and former 
    "jazz" mag, <b>Melody Maker</b> had seen fit to print a letter 
    by <b>me</b>!!! I wrote a letter to complaining about a whole series of 
    disgusting pictures in an issue of MM, and they printed it!!! And they 
    didn't slag it off either!!!! They censored it slightly, presumably for reasons 
    of space, as I couldn't see any other reason for some of the changes!!!! For 
    example, they censored my reference to "rock music journalism"!!!!!! 
  <p>Still the fact that this <b>Robin Bresnark</b> person, who was editing the letters 
    pages this week, chose to make small changes like that means that he obviously 
    was making an effort include my letter as he thought it was so bloody brillliant!!! 
    One thing I didn't like tho- they censored all the exclamation marks!!!!! So much 
    for youthful exhuberence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>You can find a copy of my original letter <a href="extras/mm.html">here</a>!!!!!</p>
  <p>Oh dear- appearing on VH-1 (See <a href="5.html#146"> issue 5</a>...) , now 
    this!!!!! We really ought to start a rock band!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Interestingly, 
    <b>Jackson Pollock</b> claims to be in a beat combo called <b>Basil</b>, 
    but I haven't heard any of their stuff yet!!!)</p>

  <h2>Not so Hotmail!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Remember the "Spartan Horse" we told you about last week? (See <a href="6.html#176"> issue 
    6</a>...) Well, someone's been quick on the draw, and found a rather 
    sneaky way of using it!!!! You might remember Microsoft bought over 
    <b>Hotmail</b>, the free web-based email service... Well, you can send 
    web pages as mail using Hotmail!!! Yep, you guessed it, you can include 
    Javascript in the mail!!! So someone's done a mail which includes Javascript 
    dialog which makes like you've just logged out of Hotmail, and then 
    asks you for your Hotmail username and password and mails it to someone!!! 
    What's really sneaky is that as Hotmail is owned by MS, they're more 
    likely to be punting it to their Internet Explorer-using users, and 
    the "Spartan Horse" trick looks much more convincing in IE!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/">http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/</a></p>
  <p><b>Update (Fri 28 Aug)</b> - MS is going to get around this by getting Hotmail
    to strip away Javascript from any web pages sent as email!!! What if it's a
    "nice" Javascript program!?!? Seems a bit of stupid idea to me, as it's
    hardly fixing the original "Spartan Horse" problem in the first place!!! MS
    should really be making sure Javascript dialogs in IE look noticably
    different from system dialogs so that no-one's fooled by them!!!<p>

  <h2>New handy computey!!!</h2>
  <p>What does Queen Victoria, the Mona Lisa, the Palmpilot have in common!?!?! Nope, 
    I've not just collected them all together in a sentence!!!!! You see, 
    Queen Victoria is (or was, to be more accurate!!!!!!) a royal, and a 
    company called Royal Consumer Business Products have just annouced 
    a low-cost handheld computer to undercut the main handheld computer 
    Palmpilot, and it's called the Da Vinci, which is named after the 
    bloke who painted the Mona Lisa!!!! You can tell I've been watching 
    "3-2-1!" on Challenge TV, can't you?!??!!?</p>

  <p>This is probably old news, but not old to Senior Citizen!!!!
    <p>
    Anyway, as they said
    in "<b>Killer Net</b>": 95% of the Internet is used for porn- or something like
    that!!!! Well, I have my doubts, because I've just seen <b>Metaspy Unfiltered</b>,
    which is the uncensored versh of <b>Metaspy</b>, which lets you know what people
    are searching for in <b>Metacrawler</b>, and 95% of it is *<i>not</i>* about porno!!! In fact,
    here's some of the requests we saw in whilst we were on for a few minutes...</p>

  <h2>Watch the Papua New Guinea tidal wave!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, one good thing about the Internet is that whenever a natural
    disaster happens, you can always watch a spiffy movie or computer
    simulation of it over and over again on the web!!!! Now you can watch a
    computer model of that tidal wave that killed zillions in Papua
    New Guinea!!! For good measure, I recommend playing "Papua New Guinea"
    by the Future Sound of London whilst viewing the movie!!!</p>

  <h2>Online shops in UK shock!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have thought that all this web-shopping business was
    just an American thing (See <a href="6.html#188"> issue 6</a>...) , but look at this!!! 
    Here's a guide to online shopping based in the *<b>UK</b>*!!!! It's actually a kind of 
    "<b>Which?</b>" for online shops, as all the shopping sites listed are reviewed, and 
    their various features and ease of use discussed... This is actually a pretty decent site!!!</p>

  <h2>Zine crazy!!!!</h2>
  <p>As we've been starting to promote our zine, we've been looking at various zine
    indexes and other zines, and there's a lot of them!!! So here are reviews of a
    few of them... We've noticed a couple of recurring categories so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Music zines!!! (Not as common as you may think!!!)
    <li>Writing & Poetry!!!
    <li>Teen zines!!!
    <li>Riot Grrl zines!!! (These are really popular!!!)
    <li>"Hip" zines, with really "clever" "essays" about culture and technology!!!
  </ul>
  <p>The last bunch are the most irritating, so we'll try and give them a miss here!!!
    Anyway, here are a few we tried at complete random!!!!<p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Suffering is Hip</b></dt>
    <dd><p>The name almost really put us off this one!!! But the graphics are really
      nice, and the writing isn't all barely readable "<b>Suck.com</b>" type stuff!!!
      And the actual point of the site is to take the piddle out of "serious" art, so
      that's pretty decent, although we wouldn't mind if they took the piddle a little
      more, and not take themselves too seriously while they're at it!!!</p>
      <p>
      <a href="http://www.sepulchritude.com/suffer/">http://www.sepulchritude.com/suffer/</a></p></dd>
    <dt><b>The Bits</b></dt>
    <dd><p>This is an interesting one, as it's not trying to be painfully hip like a lot of
      zines!!! One good feature is that in some sections, there's a form to add your
      own stuff, a bit like on Slashdot!!!</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thebits.easynet.co.uk/">http://www.thebits.easynet.co.uk/</a></p></dd>
    <dt><b>AKP Zine</b></dt>
    <dd><p>We really like this one!!! The site has a nice clean design, and more
      importantly the articles are pretty good!!! If you're used to stuff like
      the articles in <a href="../../saggie/default.html"><b>Maggie</b></a> diskmag, then you'll like this!!!</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.akp.cc/">http://www.akp.cc/</a></p></dd>
    <dt><b>MOiRAzine</b></dt>
    <dd><p>When you enter this site, you get a Javascript dialog saying <i>"If you like
      blowjobs, click on OK"</i>!!! The heading on the top of the next page is
      <i>"Slutty is good"</i>!!!! So you might get the idea that this is not a
      very subtle site!!!! And you'd be right!!! But it's quite funny!!!</p>
      <p>Actually, it doesn't really look like a zine at all, more a sort of wierd homepage!!!
      <p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~moirazine/">http://members.tripod.com/~moirazine/</a></p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>That's all for the moment, as I'm flippin' tired!!! (Editing a brilliant zine
      like this is hard work!!!!!</p>
