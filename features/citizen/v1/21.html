    <h1>Oh my God, they've killed 1998!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Wow!!!!! Who would have guessed that we would have made it
      to 1999?!?!?!? Erm, well, I would have!!!!!! Because I had to write this
      issue!!!!!!!! Even more amazing, it's our 21st issue!!!!! That means as
      a magazine, Senior Citizen is now old enough to become an MP!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I've got a couple of new years resolutions as regards Senior Citizen...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do a bit of re-designing on the general look!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Make the archive section a bit better!!!!</li>
      <li>Get a slightly more reliable mailing list for the email version
        of Senior Citizen!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'm also intending to make my own side of the making of an issue a bit
      easier and more convenient!!!!! (That would a good thing!!!!) I'll be
      doing a couple of tests of the mini re-design soon, but I'll tell you
      nearer the time!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>So, happy new year and all that!!!!!!! Now read the first issue of 1999!!!!</p>

  <h2>Radio East Milton: 'Cool'!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is 
    a very nice start to the new year!!!!!! One of our fave news sites of 
    the last year, the very nice <b>Newstrolls</b>, have given our <b>Radio 
    East Milton</b> station (See <a href="18.html#541"> issue 18</a>...) 
    a plug!!!! And from no less a person than <b>Pasty Drone</b> herself!!!! 
    <i>"Hey Old Fart! Anyone who gives a 5 weight in the playlist to BowWowWow 
    AND Public Enemy is cool by me!"</i> Thanks very much, Pasty!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Have a good old shout- on tha netweb!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, it looks like <b>Image Radio</b> no longer has the monopoly on
    letting users make their own radio stations on tha inphopipe highway
    netweb thingy!!!!! Even more significantly, (We're using big words
    today, aren't we!!!!!!) it looks like <b>Realaudio</b>'s dominance
    in the webby audio streaming department is under threat!!!!</p>
  <p>It's all thanks to this thingy called <b>Shoutcast</b> by Nullsoft-
    that's right it's the people behind <b>Winamp</b>!!!! What they've
    done is added a plugin to Winamp that allows whatever you're playing
    on Winamp (Whether it's MP3s, WAVs, MODs, YMs, etc.) to be streamed
    to a special Shoutcast server anywhere on tha netweb!!!!! Even better,
    you can download a server for Windows, and broadcast to the web on
    the same computer you're playing Winamp on!!!!! For you non-Windows
    peeps, there's also server proggies for quite a few non-wintel platforms...
    And it's all for free as well!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">http://www.shoutcast.com/</a>
  <p>This idea has really caught the Slashdot crowd on the hop- they're
    looking for ways to take the Windows part out of the equation...</p>
  <p><a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/01/06/170239.shtml">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/01/06/170239.shtml</a></p>
  <p>At the time of writing, we've been sampling (!!!!) some of the stations
    in the Shoutcast directory... By default all Shoutcast servers tell
    the main Shoutcast directory if they're broadcasting or not... (Which
    is quite handy if you're a Trading Standards person, and want to find
    out who's broadcasting copyrighted music on tha netweb without
    permission!!!!!!) In amongst the top 10 we found this little beauty!!!
    <b>Sub Ether Radio</b> broadcast whole uncut episodes of <b>The
    Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy</b>!!!!!! (And apparently they appear
    to be broadcasting the original radio episodes, rather than the
    versions released on the record...</p>
  <p><a href="http://yp.shoutcast.com/cgi-bin/shoutcast-playlist.pls?addr=209.24.232.254:8000&file=filename.pls">http://yp.shoutcast.com/cgi-bin/shoutcast-playlist.pls?<br>
                addr=209.24.232.254:8000&file=filename.pls</a></p>
  <p>Another interesting station (And one which is a bit more legit!!!!!)
    is <b>MP3.com</b>'s Top 40 Countdown, where you can hear loadsa
    unsigned acts on MP3.com's archives, which is really great, as you
    can listen to such jolly tunes as <b>X-Clan</b>'s
    "F&$ked up world"!!!!!! (A brilliant reason if there ever
    was one!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Panto Banton mk II!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Talking of MP3.com, you might remember that some time ago we mentioned one of their stranger 
    artists, some dude called <b>Chuckie Dogg Fresh</b>, who talked an awful 
    lot about "bitches" and "mo fo" people on his album "The Shit Is Wack"!!!!! 
    (See <a href="14.html#426"> issue 14</a>...) Well, we've seen his page 
    on mp3.com again recently, and there's been a couple of changes!!!! 
    For a start, the album has been renamed "This Shit *<b>Be</b>* Wack", 
    and for another, the Dogg's piccy has gone!!!! Presumably this is because 
    the "Dogg" feels that he'll get less of a slagging off from "homies" 
    who think he is a tad patronising if he doesn't put up any pic of himself!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Well, he's now got an alter-ego in the reggae section, called
    <b>Chuck Rastaboyee Fresh</b>!!!!! And in his "Nicely Stylin'", he's
    still got his original "Dogg" piccy up there!!!! As he says in his
    page: "Yum yum ladies gimme sum"!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/music/Reggae/6122.html">http://www.mp3.com/music/Reggae/6122.html</a></p>
  <p>However, in case a few people start slagging him off there as well,
    and he decides to remove his pic there, here's our local copy!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="{{ "/features/citizen/v1/graphics/dogg.jpg" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">http://seniordads.atari.org/features/citizen/graphics/dogg.jpg</a></p>
  <p>Bet you can imagine him going: <i>"Everybody in the house throw
    yo hands up in tha air!!!! And wave them around like you just
    don't care!!!!!!!!!"</i></p>

  <h2>Move over Slashdot, here's Cachedot!!!!</h2>
  <p>As you might have noticed from the Slashdot link above, those clever
    peeps at Slashdot-land have noticed that their server is getting so popular
    these days, that at some times it's very hard to get on!!!!! So they've
    started up another server called <b>Cachedot</b>, which keeps a copy of
    all the articles in Slashdot, so if you can't get in Slashdot proper,
    then you can still see the latest news here!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Like Video- only wierder!!!</h2>
  <p>Now this is interesting!!!!!! If you're having problems with working
    your video recorder, (Like forgetting where the record button is, or
    what channel to switch to!!!!) then you might like this!!!!
    <b>ReplayTV</b> is a spiffy little "short-term" video recorder that
    is able to work by itself!!!!!! That's because it uses loads of
    computer stuff, and it doesn't record on a video tape- it record
    programs on a hard drive!!!!!!!!! (That's why it's "short-term",
    presumably!!!!!!!!!) It also connects with the Replay site on tha
    inphopipe highweb, to find out when programs are, so you can record
    a proggy, and then say to the videobox thingy to record all future
    episodes... And it'll get the details from the Replay site, and
    record them!!!! You can even get it to search for unknown programs
    of a specific genere (eg sci-fi, cop drama, thrash metal, etc.), and
    it'll find them and record it for you, so you can have your own
    special "Old Fart" telly channel!!!!</p>
  <p>How long before this sortof thing blurs with the Internet, and we have a telly equivalent of
    <b>Imagine Radio</b> or <b>Shoutcast</b> on tha netweb?!?!?!
    Personally I can't wait till we can launch <b>East Milton Gold</b>,
    <b>East Milton Movies</b>, <b>East Milton Gardening</b>, and so on!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Next years MP3 players- according to Korea!!!!</h2>
  <p>You wouldn't belive how many people have been asking me: <i>"Old Fart,
    being the really 'hip' dude that you are, are you going to be getting
    one of those new-fangled <b>Rio</b> MP3 Walkman thinges?!?!?!</i>"!!!!! To
    which I say: <i>"Get out of my way, you young whippersnappers!!!!!"</i>!!!!!
    Erm, yes well anyway, here is a little article about the whole load of
    Rio-style MP3 players that are coming in from South Korea, which looks to
    dominate the MP3 Walkman market at the moment!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Encryption- with fish!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I've gone fishing a couple of times!!!!! I've never caught anything
    tho!!!!! But if I do in future, and I catch two fish, I might say:
    <i>"Aha!!!! I can encrypt my email with this!!!!!"</i> That's because
    there's this new encryption rate called Twofish encryption!!!!

  <h2>Chips on tha web- literally!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever looked at a printed circuit board and thought: "Hmmm!!!
    I wonder what this would look like if there were a big hairy spider
    crawling all over it?!?!?!?"?!?!?!?!? Well, now you can find out!!!!
    Because in this government webpage, they've got pictures... Of
    spiders crawling over silicon chips!!!!!!! Why, I do not know, but
    there must be an interesting reason for it or something!!!!! Perhaps
    the government wants to make sure that their machine will still work,
    even if big hairy spiders crawl all over them!!!!!!!!!!

  <h2>Steve Albini says- Record Companies are cowboys!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As they say, you can always trust the man who produced the final
    Nirvana album!!!!! This very informative article, by <b>Steve Albini</b>,
    the man behind that delighftul band <b>Rapeman</b>, tells you of all the
    pitfalls that can befall you if you sign with a major record label!!!!
    One very interesting part is when he mentions that crappy little pieces
    of paper can be used as legal documents, so that a record company can
    conceivably muck around with a band even before they've signed an actual
    proper contract with them!!!!! Basically, then entire article can be
    summarised in the following 3 words: "Major Labels: avoid!!!!!"!!! But
    then again, if it was just 3 words, it wouldn't be such an entertaining
    article, would it?!?!?!?!??!</p>

  <h2>Ladies & Gentlemen... The greatest Rock 'n' Roll band in the world... Pentium P2 33MHz With Soundcard!!!!!</h2>
  <p>But in the future, major labels might be using this instead!!!!!! Some
    bloke, who looks like something out of a mid 1970s Open University program,
    has knocked up this computer thingy, which makes up music in any style!!!!!
    So a future equivalent of <b>Steps</b> or Boyzone won't need to keep doing
    cover versions of other people's well-known songs!!!!!!!! But they probably
    will still use them anyway!!!!! Because they're rubbish!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>DIVX- 'astroturf'?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, you might have heard of the VHS of new video media, <b>DVD</b>, but
    you might not have yet heard of the Blockbusters/Sky Box Office of new video
    media, called <b>DIVX</b>!!!!! Unlike DVD, DIVX "software" only allows you
    to play it for a limited amount of time, then you have to pay to view it
    again!!!!!</p>
  <p>For some odd reason, a lot of people don't really like this idea!!!!! And
    there's been a lot of DVD/DIVX flamewars going on, and a lot of the pro-DVD
    websites are not too kind about DIVX!!!!!! One thing there hasn't been
    too much of though, is websites that are actually in _<i>favour</i>_ of
    DIVX- until recently, when a few of them suddenly sprang up from
    nowhere!!!!! Oddly enough, a few people on the DVD side wondered if
    the sites were actually made up by pro DIVX companies!!!!</p>

  <h2>Five fruity flavours!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Here's another thing you might remember about the early 80s!!!!!! The BBC
    Micro we all know and love was launched as part of the <b>Beeb's Computer
    Literacy Programme</b>, another part of which was this telly proggy called
    "<b>The Computer Programme</b>"!!!!! (Funky name, huh?!?!?) The title
    sequence had some owl flying about whilst "Computer World" by those Kraftwerk
    dudes played in the background!!!!!</p>
  <p>You might remember that, but do you remember the very first bit in the
    very first ever programme, just before the titles ran?!?!?! Well, I do!!!!
    It was this sort of "comedy sketch" thing, with Roy Kinnear as the bloke
    who ran a computer shop, and Fred Harris (From that classic telly show,
    "Leapfrog"!!!) as a really naive person wanting to buy a computer!!!! At one
    point, Fred wondered what colours the computers were available in, and we
    all rolled in the isles (Laughing!!!!) because we knew that you couldn't
    get computers in different colours!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Well, Fred has the last laugh now!!!! Apple are now releasing their iMacs
    in five different colours!!!!!!! So now someone who knows nothing about
    computers can now walk into a computer shop, ask for a computer in green,
    and we won't be able to laugh at them any more!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    work on *<b>electronic ink</b>*!!!!!!!! This sort of stuff can be put on a
    page, and you can apply an electric signal to it, and the appearance of the
    ink changes!!!!! So it's a bit like a big monitor screen- on a page of

  <p>Now I bet you thought a <b>Jabber</b> was what young people called a
    hypodermic syringe!!!!!!!! Well, you'd be wrong!!!!!!!! It's actually
    a Linux messaging system, bit like ICQ, and that bloody annoying Netscape AOL
    Instant Messenger proggy that starts up when I use the internet!!!!! (And
    I can't flippin' get rid of it either!!!!!!! It's even worse than those
    bloody disks they stick in every computing magazine!!!!!! It really gets
    up my nose!!!!!!!!!) Erm, anyway!!! It's like those two progs, but it's
    compatible with both of them!!!!! It also uses that spiffy XML business-
    and it's open source!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Serial Doomsayer!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As we mentioned before, there are some loopy survivalist types, who see the Y2K bug 
    as the lastest candidate for causing society to break down!!!!!! (See 
    <a href="4.html#109"> issue 4</a>...) So it's no surprise to see this 
    person pitching in!!!!!!! Apparently he's been predicting the apocalypse 
    for years!!!! Only one thing tho- he keeps changing the date and the 
    cause of the apocalypse!!!!! At the moment it's Y2K, but if he gets 
    that one wrong, then he'll probably change again and predict a big meteorite 
    or whatever!!!! What he doesn't say that much is that the reason he's 
    wanting the apocalypse to get a bloody move on is that he's wanting 
    to meet Jesus or something!!!! Why he doesn't instead just place an 
    ad in the personal ad section in a newspaper is anyone's guess!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Will they draw the line at this?!?!?!?! (Doh!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>If you've got lots of awesome realtime graphics computing power, how would
    you use it to imporve your football coverage?!?!?!? Well, according to
    this telly channel in the US, you would use all those computers to draw a
    little line on the pitch!!!!!!!!!! Yes, this lot are using loads of technology
    in order to seemlessly draw a "ten yard line" on shots of an American football
    pitch, in real-time during a match!!!!!!!!! Maybe in future, we could have
    computer enhanced TV coverage of football matches over here... Though if
    it was Partick Thistle playing, it would probably need more enhancement than
    current computing power can provide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>This one's a card- literally!!!!! (Almost!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Someone at that NT course I'm on discovered this trick on tha web!!!!!!
    It's a very neat card trick- and it uses no sneaky stuff like CGI or
    Java/Javascript!!!!!! So how is it done?!?!?! Well, have a go yourself,
    and see if you can work it out.... After a little examination and testing,
    we found out how it worked, and we were kicking ourselves!!!!!!!!!</p>
