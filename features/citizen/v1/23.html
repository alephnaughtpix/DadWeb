    <h1>This Is Your Bloody (Late!!!) Valentine!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>There are a lot of people at the moment knocking Glen Hoddle because of
      his remarks about disabled people!!!!!!!!! Well, OK, the comments were a bit
      "off" to say the least, but I really think people should leave him alone!!!!
      After all, an ability to put one's foot in one's mouth so spectacularly is
      obviously a punishment for sins in a previous life, isn't it?!?!?!??!! (Ho
      ho!!!!!)</p>
    <p>I noticed something else this week!!!!!! And it begs a question: who decided
      that Hot Chocolate were hip again?!??!?! Not that I'm complaining of course,
      but I'm starting to see Hot Chocolate "Greatest Hits" compils appearing out
      of nowhere, and now their singer Errol Brown's popped up, singing their late
      70s ballad "I'll Put You Back Togther Again" on an ad for hot chocolate
      (Boom boom!!!) drinks!!!!</p>
    <p>And this is not the first time the band have become hip again!!!! They did
      it before (twice!!!!!!) in the 80s!!!!!!! There must be some comittee
      somewhere that decides these things!!!!!!! And I'd like to get in contact
      with them, in order to get advance warning so that next time I can dig out
      all my old Hot Choclate records from the attic, and make everyone think I'm
      really hip!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Strike a match- and serve a webpage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, none of 
    us smoke or anything, so we don't really need any safety matches!!!!!! 
    Unless of course our electricity gets cut off!!!!! But in future we 
    might be using a matchbox all the time- to serve webpages!!!!!!!!!! 
    That's because the world's smallest webserver hardware has been made, 
    and it's the size of a box of matches!!!!!!!!! Check it out on this 
    webpage, which is served by the same webserver!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Going Down(load) to Rio!!!!!!! (Doh!!!!!!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, we might 
    have been a bit retisent (Is that how you spell it?!?) to get one of 
    those Rio MP3 players, because after all it's the first of the bunch, 
    and you can imagine what the first Sony Walkman was like!!!!!!!!! But 
    we might get one now!!!!!!!! That's because, thanks to some spiffy new 
    open source software, you can now use it as a mobile hard drive!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Yes, that's right, thanks to this stuff, you can download and upload 
    files from your Rio, and not just MP3/Wavs either!!!!! There are two 
    versions of this software, one is more "Windowsy" and the other is more 
    "Linuxy"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.world.co.uk/sba/rio.htm">http://www.world.co.uk/sba/rio.htm</a> </p>
    <p>We found out about this by way of a very nice new MP3 news site 
      called <b>MP3 Place</b>!!!!! Check it out!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.mp3place.com/">http://www.mp3place.com/</a> 
    <p>At least they haven't gone completely mad about this new development!!!! 
      Unlike <b>Wired News</b>, who seem to getting more hysterical of late!!!!!!!!!! 
      Which we're sure is nothing to do with the fact that they're now that 
      they're basically just a big news service after all the "trendy" bits 
      of Wired Digital were chopped by their new owners!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="8.html#251"> 
      issue 8</a>...) We've already reported on them trying to get "hip" 
      again with that "drugs" story, (See <a href="22.html#647"> issue 22</a>...) 
      now they're reporting this story, giving it an "Oh woe is MP3 now!!!!!!! 
      And all because these wily hackers have torpodoed the Rio by making 
      it doing something that the Recording Industry of America won't like!!!!!!!!" 
      type spin!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>2987: What the f$&^%s going on?!?!?!</h2>
  <p><img src="graphics/pictures/666.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" height="151" width="104" alt="[Story no. 666!!!!] "> 
    If you as old as me, you might dimly remember a spiffy little musical 
    group called <b>The KLF</b>!!!!!!! You might even remember that they 
    were also called <b>The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu</b> or <b>The JAMMs</b>, 
    and they did this interesting album called "<b>1987: What the F@&%s 
    Going On?"</b>, which had loadsa samples on it!!!!! Unfortuntely one 
    of the people sampled was Abba, and their manager decided to sue their 
    rear entrances off the JAMMs unless they destroyed the album and it's 
    master tapes!!!!!!!!!!!! So they did!!!!!! And it's now an extremely 
    difficult album to get hold of!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Fast forward 12 years later, and we were checking out the latest 
      new music in the vaults of <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a> 
      , and we found a section for a group called "<b>The Jams</b>", and 
      yep, apparently it's the same lot!!!!!!! And there's two new tunes 
      from them on their section!!!!!! The first of them is called <b>"3AM 
      Impure Trance</b>, which is billed as <i>"The White House Music Anthem, 
      featuring the vocal talents of Mrs.Hillary Rodham Clinton."</i>!!!!!! 
      The second is called <b>"Viva Viagra"</b>, and I bet you can't guess 
      what that's all about!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/jams">http://www.mp3.com/jams</a> </p>
  <p>But that's not all!!!!!!! These two tracks are apparently tasters 
      for a new JAMMs album called *"<b>2987</b>"*, which is being released 
      on 23rd February!!!!!! Why the music papers haven't reported on this 
      momentous occasion, we do not know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But you can read 
      about it on their slightly cheapo looking website here... Well, they've 
      burned a million pounds, what do you expect their website to look 
      like?!?!?! Really professional?!?!?!?! </p>

  <h2>Clothes- with a command line!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wanted what sort of clothes "The Gimp" from "Pulp Fiction" might wear 
    in the future!?!?!?! Well, he might wear these clothes, as he'll be 
    able to run "Gimp" on it!!!!!!!!!!! Because these clothes have <i>"the 
    computational power of a UNIX workstation"</i>!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, that's 
    right, they're wearable computes!!!!!!!!!!! You'll proably need to type 
    "startclothes &" at the command line to put them on tho!!!!!

  <p>Well, you might be eagerly playing "Tiger Woods 99 PGA World Tour" whilst searching 
    for the South Park anim on it, (See <a href="2.html#657"> issue 2</a>...) 
    but what if you're a really really crap player?!?!?!?!? Well, you might 
    want to read this publication called "<b>Bad Golfing Monthly</b>"!!!!!! 
    So if you get a "birdie", then you don't need to be too worried!!!!!! 
    Unless of course the RSPCA is in the area!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>In the new millenium- play pinball!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, it's great to see that when 2000 comes around, not all of us will be playing gigantic 
    3D texture-phong-shade-mapped Quake XVVXIIIVa type games!!!!!! Some 
    are going to be playing pinball!!!! At least this lot think so!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Because they've launched a pinball machine called <b>"Pinball 2000"</b>!!!!!! 
    On this web page, they say : <i>"Introducing Pinball 2000, the most 
    TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED pin the world has ever seen."</i> Which of 
    course is not really interesting to most people, as they want to know 
    about the pinball machine!!!!!! I mean, who's really interested in knowing 
    about the pins holding it together?!?!?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Computing- with dots!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever recently played a game of dominoes, looked at the pieces, and thought: 
    <i>"Wouldn't it be great if I could base a new method of computing on 
    this?!?!?!?!?"</i> Well, if you haven't it's a bit late now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Because someone's already started working on using quantum dots- for 
    quantum computing!!!! Apparently it uses electrons or something.</p>

  <h2>This computing lark is chaos- literally!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>That Jon Katz 
    person certainly knows how to get people annoyed!!!!! One of his recent 
    columns on Slashdot tangled with the throny issue of articifical intelligence, 
    and whether it's possible soon or not... Katz argued it was!!!!!!!! 
    Just add more fuel to the fire, he argued it in the middle of a book 
    review by some bloke, who had also argued in favour of artificial intelligence 
    soon-ish, but had done so in such a way as to hype up his own consulting 
    agency!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p> The comments following it were even more enjoyable!!!!!!!! They 
    started off with the usual "Woah!!! Kewl!!! Hook me up, man!!!" type 
    comments, then the "Oh, it'll never happen!!!!!!!!" type guff took 
    over!!!!!!!! At which point things degenerated to the point where 
    people were arguing about the Turing Test, (Where you have a conversation 
    with someone over a text console linkup, and you've to determine on 
    that basis alone whether or not you've been talking with a computer 
    or a real person!!!!!) with the usual "But, even if they do pass the 
    Turing Test, computers don't have any soul, man!!!" type arguments 
    (Which is completely irrelevant to the Turing Test anyway!!!!!!), 
    and there was even a spot of Evolution vs Creationism arguments!!!!!! 
    All in all, the most hilarious load of comments we've ever seen, since 
    we looked at ITV Teletext Viewer Letters on p327 yesterday, anyway!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p> <a href="http://cachedot.slashdot.org/books/99/01/18/198243.shtml">http://cachedot.slashdot.org/books/99/01/18/198243.shtml</a> 
  <p> But Katz and co. may soon have the last laugh!!!!! Apparently some 
    clever scientest people have perfected a "dynamics-based computation" 
    technique that uses chaotic elements to "evolve" answers!!!!! This 
    is apprently a new alternative to the usual digital computing methods, 
    and apparently <i>"may be well suited for optical computing using 
    ultra-fast chaotic lasers and computing with silicon/neural tissue 
    hybrid circuitry"</i>!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p> Argh!!! "Silicon/neural tissue hybrid"?!?!?! Isn't that what the 
    Borg are made of, or something?!?!?!?!? I wouldn't like to be assimilated 
    by a dynamics-based computer whilst trying to get it to "evolve" an 
    answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Ideas to make your 'box' hot!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Here's an interesting 
    ideads site- and for a change it's actually from Britain this time!!!!!!!!! 
    However, there's one prob- this spiffy UK new ideas site is called <b>Hotbox</b>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    (!!!!!) We were half expecting to hear lewd and suggestive noises when 
    we got onto this website!!!!!!!!!!! But it's not like that!!!!!!!! There 
    are in fact a lot of interesting "hardware" ideas- and not the sort 
    of you thinking dirty persons!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p> One interesting idea is to transform any b/w photo into the first 
    few thousand numbers of <b>Pi</b>, arranged in such a way as to look 
    like the original photo!!!!!!!!!!! So, if you're ever calculating 
    the circumference of a circle, and you're wondering what the first 
    few thousand numbers of Pi are (in order to be really accurate!!!!), 
    you can just look very carefully at this special photograph of yourself, 
    and find out!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Homepage on tha NetWeb- literally!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>When you chuck the rubbish into the bin, have you ever thought: <i>"It's a shame I 
    don't have a barcode reader with me, or I would be able to scan the 
    items, and post the results on the Internet, so that everyone would 
    know what's in my rubbish bin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i>!??!?!?! Well, that 
    what this guy has done!!!!!!!!!!!! In fact, he's wired up his toilet, 
    as well as a few video cams in his house, to the megamighty Inphopipeweb!!!!!!!! 
    So now you can find out when gets food out of the fridge, when he eats 
    it and throws away the wrapper into the bin, and when it comes out at 
    the other end and he flushes the toilet!!!!! You can even see a webcam 
    of his PC desktop, and find out what he's playing in Winamp!!!!!!! (When 
    we looked, it was: "Find a way to my heart" by Phil Collins- groovy!!!!)</p>
  <p>This site has also been mentioned in Slashdot!!!!! Quite a few people 
    noted that he was using Windows 95 and various Microsoft stuffs, leading 
    to the really odd commment from someone: <i>"I'd rather have a house 
    without windows"</i>!!!!!!!! Won't it be a bit dark then?!?!?!??!!</p>

  <h2>NASA: We're full!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now some of you readers might have occasionally had their disk drive filling up, and 
    have had to get rid of all the rubbish files on the drive to get more 
    space!!!!!!!!! Well, whatever you do, don't get rid of your back copies 
    of <b>SENIOR CITIZEN</b>!!!!!!!!! Erm, anyway!! If you've had that problem, 
    then you might want to give advice to NASA!!!!! That's because NASA 
    are currently having a bit of a problem with storing all the data from 
    their records!!!!!! They're especially having problems with updating 
    out of date data formats- it takes four years to convert to new data 
    format which will probably have to be converted again within 6 years 
    anyway!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>It's War... On Tha NetWeb!!!!!</h2>
  <p>People always say I look as if I'd been through "the wars"!!!!!!!!!! Mind you, they're 
    right!!!!!!!!!!!!! But the same might happen to you if you go online!!!!!!!! 
    That because apparently the first online military action between two 
    countries has taken place!!!!!!!! And the two countries are: West Timor 
    vs East Timor!!!!!!!!!! If you don't know, West Timor occupies East 
    Timor and says to the rest of the world that it's really part of West 
    Timor!!!!!! Some people from East Timor who are a little miffed-off 
    at this state of affairs started a server based in Ireland for their 
    protests, and this week people from West Timor launched a hacking attack 
    against it!!!</p>

  <h2>Pentium IIIs- you're banned!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Imagine you're 
    an important lawyer person in Arizona!!!! What sort of flagship law 
    would you try and get passed?!?!?!?! Well, how about a law banning the 
    successor to the Intel Pentium II processor?!?!?!?!?!? Well, that's 
    what this law-person has done!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

  <p>You might notice from that article that there's a privacy issue 
    involved!!!! Apparently each of these new Pentium III chips has a 
    unique serial ID, and this can be found out by software, which means 
    that when you're online, outside software can potentially track you 
    as your surf using the ID number in your Pentium III chip!!!!!!!! 
    Some people are now calling a boycott on Intel groups!!!!! 
  <p>Faced with all this, Intel has decided it would a nice idea (Especially 
    for their factories in Arizona!!!!!!) back down a bit.... Apparently, 
    you'll be able to "switch off" the reporting of the ID num!!!!!!!! 
    But the number's still there!!!!!!!! So, the privacy groups are still 
    not pleased!!!!!!! And the boycott is still going on!!!!!!!! </p>

    I have!!!!!!!!!! Well, this might make it interesting!!!! Some combo 
    called <b>ThemeScape</b> can analyse gigantic amounts of data, and produce

  <h2>If you read this, a virus will vapourise your Pentium!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Only joking!!!!!!!!!!! 
    But some people aren't!!!!!!!!!!!! Since that "Good Times" virus scare 
    a couple of years ago, there seems to be lots of people who keep passing 
    on these silly messages that say something like <i>"If you see a message 
    with the subject "TEST", don't read it!!!!!! It contains the computer 
    equivalent of BSE, and it will destroy your hard drive, then send your 
    processor into an nth complexity binary loop that will cause the chip 
    to collapse in on itself and generate a minature black hole, which will 
    destroy your computer, before decaying through quantum leakage into 
    a nuclear explosion, equivalent to 5 megatons!!!!!! Then you'll get 
    squished by a meteorite."</i>!!!!!!!!!!! The viruses are obviously bogus, 
    but that doesn't stop people forwarding these messages on!!!!!!!!! In 
    fact, some people say that it's the *<b>messages</b>* that are really 
    the viruses themselves!!!!!! Anyway, if you want to find out about all 
    the various types of these really stupid messages, then go to this interesting 
    page!!!!!!!!! And you'd better be quick!!!!!!!! Because if you continue 
    to read this message, a virus will erase you from time and space!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
