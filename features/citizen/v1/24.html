    <h1>This Is Your Bloody (Late!!!) Valentine!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>This a lot later than I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because I was upgrading
    some of the system on the Senior Dads Linux box "<b>Godzilla</b>"!!!!!!!!
    We had to get a lot of things fixed on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, our fave
    Tux Box (!!!!! In fact, it's our only one!!!!!!!!!!!!!) is now running that
    spiffy desktop for Linux, <b>KDE</b>!!!!! It's great!!!!!!!!!! It's like the
    nice GUI features of Windows, but it's based on a stable operating which
    doesn't crash all the time!!!!!!!! (I've heard at <b>ZDnet</b> have had a
    similarly nice time when they were reviewing Linux!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently they
    were really amazed that it didn't crash at all while they were reviewing
    it!!!!!!!!) </p>
    <p>Anyway, that's why it's a week late!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is that you're saying:
    you thought it was two weeks late!??!?!?! Well, I was attempting to add a
    network card in my computers that week!!!!!!!!!!!! It was an extremely
    hard job- and when I get the bloody thing working, I'll let you know in a
    future issue of Senior Citzen!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, here was the editorial I
    wrote a week ago....</p>
    <p>Pah!!!!!! Valentine's day!!!!!! Who needs it!?!??!?!?!? If you thought Xmas
    or Easter was a bit commercialised, then you've obviously forgotten about
    this day!!!!!!!!!! Is there really anything to Valentines day other than
    buying some crappy card or box of chocolates?!?!?!?! (Both of which are at
    hiked-up prices!!!!!!!) Not that I can see!!!!!!!! You can do that any time
    of the year, so why is 14th February so flippin' special?!?!?!? I mean, I
    know it's traditional, but you could say the same about slavery or
    diptheria, and I don't see too many people mourning the passing of either,
    do you?!?!?!?!?!? And this "anonymous" business is really stupid as well!!!!
    If you really want to have it off with someone, how on Earth can you
    do "it" without knowing who the other flippin' person is, or vice-versa?!?!
    Even in the non-"having it off" stakes, sending cards anonymously to
    someone hardly amounts to what I would call a flippin' healthy romantic
    relationship!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>What do you mean "You're listening to that anti-Valentine compil CD that came
    free with this week's <b>Melody Maker</b>, aren't you!!!!!!!"!?!??!?!? Erm,
    well, yes, but it's actually a really good one!!!!! I mean, I don't exactly
    remember the last time MM gave away a free tape or CD which included Fear
    Factory and Sepultura, as opposed to the usual tepid indie bollocks!!!!!!!
    Probably the best giveaway from MM since their infamous "Romo" tape!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Crackers are cracking up- thanks to Wired!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>How we managed 
    to miss this little gem we don't know!!!!!!! Remember we noted previously 
    that <b>Wired News</b> were starting to get a little more tabloidy and 
    hysterical?!??!?!! (See <a href="23.html#665"> issue 23</a>...) Well, 
    check this one out!!!!!!!! Here's the opening para from a recent article 
    entitled "Cracking the Mind of the hacker": </p>
    <blockquote>"The average computer cracker is an obsessive
    middle-class white male, between 12 and 28 years old, with few social
    skills and a possible history of physical and sexual abuse."</blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/17427.html?wnpg=all">http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/17427.html?wnpg=all</a></p>
    <p>Yup, sounds like a completely reasonable unbiased non-hysterical statement to
    us as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, surprisly, some crackers/hackers/whatever
    Wired decides to call them these days!!!/who cares?!?!? are a little put out
    by this article!!!!!!!!!! So here's a complete slag-off of it!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>RealAudio- watch out for the 'wavelets'!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, you might 
    be used to the "AM"-like sound quality of RealAudio, but if you've tried 
    to actually get visual stuff going on your player, you'll know that 
    the resulting pictures look a little like what you would get if you 
    filmed the televison on a cheap camcorder with a plastic bag over the 
    lens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, apparently some people called <b>High 
    Speed Net Solutions</b> have fixed that problem with a way of sending 
    much clearer pictures over tha NetWeb with an average frame rate of 
    30 fps!!!!! Apparently it uses "wavelet-based technology" or something 
    like that!!!!!!! What with this, and Shoutcast challenging RealAudio's 
    dominance of streaming audio, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</a>...) 
    it looks like RealNetworks are going to have to pull their socks up!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    (Which, as some of you might say, is a little rich coming from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) </p>

  <h2>We are sailing- on tha NetWeb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this initially looked like another boring old story of some group
    starting up yet another flippin' commerical music provider site, but
    something caught our eye on this one!!!!! The group are called <b>MediaX</b>,
    the site is <a href="http://www.amuznet.com">http://www.amuznet.com</a> or something, but apparently this is not
    the first time MediaX launched a music website!!!!!!!! They've done
    "celebrity sites", such as <a href="http://www.rodstewartlive.com">http://www.rodstewartlive.com</a> "and others to
    be announced soon"!!!!!!!!!! We can't wait to see what they come up with
    next!!!!!!!!!! Would it be too much to hope that we'll soon be seeing
    <a href="http://www.nik-kershaw-live.com/">http://www.nik-kershaw-live.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.debbie-gibson-live.com/">http://www.debbie-gibson-live.com/</a> ?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Yahoo Suck!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, that's what quite a lot of people are already saying on tha NetWeb Usenet
    bbs thingy!!!!!!! But what they might not be aware of is that they're
    unwittingly advertising a new site!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's called (drum roll!!!) ...
    erm, <b>Yahoo Suck!</b>, and it's a web portal.... Erm, a little bit like
    Yahoo!!!!! You might think "What the feck (!!!!!) is the point of
    that?!?!??!?", but apparently this accepts a lot of the sites that Yahoo won't
    or can't accept, because they're too naughty, or they've forgotten about them,
    or can't be bothered, or whatever excuse they give!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p> Well, this one is a little different!!!!!!!!! One of the sections one it's 
    front page is "<b>Internet Sex</b>"!!!!!!!!! What's really funny is 
    that at the time of writing, this heading has a little icon next to 
    it- it's the icon from "Zing!"!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="10.html#312"> 
    issue 10</a>...) We don't know how long this icon is going to last!!!!!!!!!!! 
    Mind you, we don't know how long the entire site is going to last, 
    given that Yahoo has already launched legal action against a "French 
    tobacco" site called <b>Yahooka</b>!!!!!!! But we think this lot are 
    really sound!!!!!!!!!! After all, their site uses <b>MySQL</b>, the 
    same database program we use to make up our issues of Senior Citizen!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
    So they must be really intelligent!!!!!!!! </p>

  <h2>Network Card has 'gigabits'!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, as you might 
    know, SDHQ is currently in the throes of adding a network between our 
    two PC computers, <b>Andrew Ridgely</b> (The Windowsy one!!!!) and <b>Godzilla</b>!!!! 
    (The Linuxy one!!!) Well, it's extremely tough work to get the flippin' 
    thing working, but by the time I do get it going "on the ball" (As they 
    say, in the business!!!!!!!!!) I'll be able to upgrade it to this super-duper 
    network type thing, which can apparently shift "gigabits" of data!!!!!!!!! 
    (What, like whole pictures or something?!?!?!??!) Only problem is, I 
    can't immediately see exactly what I'd be able to do with my computers 
    in order to generate gigabits of data in order to be able to shift it 
    around this network!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless I was to broadcast the details 
    of every lavatory flush from my house on tha NetWeb like that young 
    man from Holland!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="23.html#673"> issue 23</a>...)</p>

  <h2>Sorry, our game's crap!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, the impression you might get from some games "mags" is that people in the
    games industry have big egos, like they're rock stars or something!!!!!!!! If
    so, no doubt you'll be a bit surprised to learn that one game company is
    really ashamed of one of it's games, and is trying to say sorry for it!!!!!!!
    <b>Sierra</b> released <b>NFL Football Pro '99</b>, and then decided to recall
    all 50,000 copies because it was buggy!!!!!!! They then to people that had
    already bought a full refund and free game, or patches and a discount toward
    buying the next version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Mind you, they are called "Sierra"!!!!!!!!!! If your company is named after a
    crap 70s car, then you probably don't have too many problems with your
    ego!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>This HD... doesn't move!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You'll probably remember that jolly nice Ashford & Simpson song from the 80s that we 
    might have mentioned previously.... (See <a href="6.html#180"> issue 
    6</a>...) Well, if that song was recorded today, it would now go: <i>"And 
    now we're solid!!!!!!!!! (Wooh!!! Yeah!!! etc) Solid as a hard drive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i> 
    That's because these really clever people have made a <b>solid state</b> 
    hard-drive which doesn't move or anything!!!!!!!! It would certainly 
    make a difference from the old banger in Godzilla's innards, as I always 
    keep saying!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Radio West Milton?!?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Some of you young 
    sprites might dimly remember that at the end of last year the <b>Senior 
    Dads</b> multimedia empire expanded a little bit!!!!!!!!!!! We are of 
    course talking about our brillibobs all-music-and-no-talk internet radio 
    station, <b>Radio East Milton</b>!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="18.html#541"> 
    issue 18</a>...) Now, some of you might be saying: "Well, your playlist 
    of stuff like Abba, The Jesus & Mary Chain, The Beach Boys, Public Enemy 
    and Bow Wow Wow is really wicked, man, but when are you lot going to 
    do your own flippin' radio progs?!?!?!" The answer is- we don't have 
    time to do a whole flippin' live radio station, you idiots!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
  <p>But these are pretty exciting days for internet radio fans!!!!!!!! Not only
    are there big libraries of music like <b>Imagine Radio</b>, (Who do our radio
    station!!!!!) there was also recently Nullsoft's spiffy <b>Shoutcast</b>,
    which allowed anything that could be played on Winamp to be broadcast on tha
    NetWeb like it was a RealAudio server!!!!!!! Now here's a new one- and it's a
    "talkie" equivalent of Imagine Radio!!!!!!! And it allows you to add your own
    programmes!!!!!! This spiffy lot are called <b>Radio Orang</b> for some
    reason, and they've got heaps of programmes and various bits contributed by
    outside people!!!!! You can stitch all these bits together in your own
    playlist, and publish that playlist!!!!!!!!!! So, who knows!!!! Maybe, we'll
    be able to stich together our own playlist, add a couple of our own bits, and
    bring out <b>Radio West Milton</b>!!!!!!!!!!!! Not that we're promising
    anything of course!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Warriors: draw your swords- literally!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever saw one of theose really boring "arts" shows on late at night,
    and thought: <i>"This art's show's really boring!!!!!!!!! Wouldn't it be great
    if someone crossed it with 'Gladiators'?!?!??!"?!?!??!??! Well, that's what
    someone's done in Japan!!!!!!!!!!! In <i>"Takeshi no Daredemo Pikaso"
    (Takeshi's Anyone Can Be Picasso)</i> there's a section called "Art
    Battle"!!!!! Presumably the competitors have to draw something on a pad, and
    then hit the other person over the head with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that's
    how I'd do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>See Holly on tha Telly- in HoloTelly!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, you'll probably be watching this latest series of "<b>Red Dwarf</b>" on
    your little tellyboxes, but did you know that in future when you see "Holly" on
    tha screen, you'll be able to see every crevasse on his baldy head- in 3D!!!!
    That's because finally someone's actually worked out how to do 3D telly
    without those little glasses with bits of cellophane or Polaroid film in
    them!!!!!!!!!! And even better, it's done using hologrammes!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Now, before you think I've been reading one of those old sci-fi magazines, I
    have to tell you that this time someone's actually made it work!!!!!
    Apparently all you need is a backlit LCD screen, and a special holographic
    pattern!!!!!!! This pattern splits the image on the LCD screen into two images
    which travel to each eye seperately, just like with a static hologramme!!!!!
    So, you can send two perspected 3D images to the screen- and you'll see the 3D
    effect!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>As with a static hologramme, you generally have to be in front of the telly to
    get the 3D effect, but then if you're watching "Red Dwarf" from the flippin'
    kitchen, then I wouldn't exactly think that you're too interested in the 3D
    effects!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It'll be quite amusing tho to watch Rimmer say
    he's a "hard light" hologramme- when we're watching him as a "soft light"
    hologramme!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>I've got a 50 inch-er!!!!!!!! (ooh-err!!!!!!)</h2>
  <p>Well, as they say, size is important!!!!!!!!!!!! Especially if you've got 20
    inches, like I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about the size of my
    television screen!!!!!!!!!! But in future I might be feeling a little
    inadequate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because Pioneer are now making *<b>50
    inch</b>* plasma-based telly screens!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Don't mess with us- we've got guns!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Only in America, as they say- in the business!!!!!!!!! Apparently some game
    called <b>"Deer Avenger"</b> has been shifting quite a lot of "units" in the
    US!!!!!!! And quite a lot of people are annoyed about it!!!!!!!! That's
    because it's a pisstake of hunter in America!!!!!!!!!! And for some reason
    hunters in America don't quite seem to get the joke!!!!!!!!!!! They're
    actually calling for a boycott of the game company!!!!!!!!!! Er, hang on!!! If
    they're hunters, then surely they'll be out all the time, and won't be playing
    computer games!!!!!!!!!!!! So a boycott wouldn't really make that much
    difference would it?!??!?!?!?!?! Anyway, they're all huffy and stuff, and are
    say things like: <i>"we do care for the environment, we do care for children
    and family morals."</i> In which case, I'd like to be there when they explain
    to their children why it's really moral to go out and blast Bambi's brains
    out!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Loch Ness Webcam!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, one prize that hunters may want to "bag" is the Loch Ness
    Monster!!!!!!!! The only prob is that it's not exactly been sporting enough
    to give "Nessie" hunters a fair chance to blow it away it with a machine
    gun!!!!!!! But thanks to this lovely site, you can now see a live videocam of
    Loch Ness, and watch out for any "beasties"!!!!!! I bet we'll see loads of
    people "spotting" a dark pixel somewhere on a webcam picture, and if it goes
    away on the next picture, they'll say they've seen the monster!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Will Blue Peter put their website in their 'capsule' now?!?!?!?</h2>
  <p>Remember those old episodes of Blue Peter when they still had Valerie
    Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves on it?!?!??!?!?! They always kept
    doing this thing nearly every year where they'd get some kid from a local
    primary school to sift through their rubbish, and then stick it in a "time
    capsule" which was buried in the "Blue Peter Garden", (What happened to
    that?!?!?! Did they pave it over and turn it into an accounting department or
    something!??!?!?!?!) so that in 25 years, if Blue Peter was still going, the
    presenters would be able to dig it up, and find out what rubbish they used to
    throw out then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Well, now someone at <b>MIT</b> have decided to do a webby version of
    it!!!!!!!!!! This "digital Time capsule" is going to be stored for
    5 years- that may not sound like a lot of time, but in dog years,
    as well as internet years, it's actually quite a long time!!!!!!!!!!!! And
    like the "proper" time capsule, it's mostly filled with complete
    rubbish!!!!!!!!! Check this out: it's going to contain:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>"An online guide that helps parents talk to their kids about the
      impeachment of President Clinton, along with an audio clip of his Senate
      impeachment trial, as played over a local radio station's Web site."</li>
      <li>"A snapshot of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's 28 January Senate
      testimony on the Net-stock mania, along with portions of Web pages and news
      accounts of the seemingly unrelenting wave of Internet deals.</li>
      <li>"A page from online auction house eBay and cyberspace offerings from more
      traditional retailers such as Spiegel and Victoria's Secret. The latter
      hosted a much-ballyhooed webcast of a lingerie fashion show."</li>
      <li>"Women-oriented sites such as Advancing Women, a service designed to help
      working women, and Women-Connect-Asia, an online network for women living
      and working in Asia."</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bet you can't wait to see the reaction when that capsule's re-opened, huh!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>We're using an MS patent!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>And we didn't even know it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because as part of a
    well-designed website (Well, OK, we are going to update the look pretty
    soon- stop annoying us you impatient people!!!!!!!!!!!) we are using the
    world-wide standard of webby <b>stylesheets</b> to help us with certain
    thingies such as font styles and so on... Well, MS has only gone and patented
    this idea!!!!!!!!! And it's atually patented "stylesheets" as a general idea,
    so this affects all it's competitors wordprocessing software, as well as
    every SGML document system, and future standards such as XML, which rely on
    stylesheets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  <p> Luckily MS are allowing people to use stylesheets for free, and US patents 
    such as this one don't apply to our webserver, (Which is based Glasgow, 
    Scotland, MS Lawyers!!!!!!!!!!) but there is some doubt as to whether 
    MS can legally patent something which is already an open standard 
    and has been for some time!!!!!!!!! Mind you, this doesn't seem to 
    have stopped MS before- a quick look at the US patents database website 
    shows that MS have patented quite a few things that could be considered 
    already existing open standards!!!! Some people are suggesting that 
    this is part of the "battle plan" as detailed in the <b>Hallowe'en 
    Memo</b>, (See <a href="15.html#449"> issue 15</a>...) whereby MS 
    are supposed to "embrace and extend" existing open source standards, 
    so that no-one else can use them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    if you had this hard drive, you'd have 100 of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's
    because we are of course not really talking about "gigs", but
    "gigabytes"!!!!!!!!!!! Someone's just done a 100 Gig HD drive!!!!!!!!! Mind
    you, you'd probably be able to store at least a 100 actual "gigs" on this

    software vendors would love a little attention from Microsoft
    Corp."</i>!!!!!!!!! Well, apparently the dudes who do <b>BeOS</b> don't!!!!!!!
    In fact, they're asking Microsoft to stop using them as evidence of
    "competitors" in their statements in the US courts!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Jack Frost would like this computer!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>As you might know, that super-dupey K6 Pentium thingy in your PC box
    does generate a lot of heat!!!!!!!!! If you were an "enviromentally freindly"
    type person, you'd probably be able to use the heat generated to boil water so
    you can have a nice cup of tea!!!!!!!!! Or stick a small wind-power generator
    next to the fan in order to power your computer!!!!!!!!!!! But have you ever
    thought about using it as a fridge?!?!??!?!!? Well, this lot appear to be
    working on it!!!!!!!!! Here you can read about people experimenting with a
    really efficient heat-sink!!!!!!!!!! In fact, it's so efficient, it actually
    generates frost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which would be really great on a summer days
    when I want to store ice cubes for my "ginger beer", but unfortunately, in
    current weather conditions, it would give me hypothermia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>OK, we've been caught with our pants down over MP3 then!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this is interesting!!!!!!!!! While over here in Europe, pop stars
    such as The Corrs have been giving us sob stories about how the MP3 format is
    depriving them of record sales, (Though in the case of The Corrs, I think it
    might have something more to do with their music!!!!!!!!!! I certainly have no
    desire to download an MP3 of their rubbishy Ballykissangel/Lighthouse
    Family type crapola!!!!) in the US, the major labels are going to be testing
    actual digital music sales!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course, it's not really MP3 they're
    using, but a more "secure" method... It is however being backed by Warners, Sony,
    Universal, EMI, and the "Bertelsmann Music Group", whoever they are!!!!!!!!!
    So it looks as though the majors are trying to catch up with all those
    forward-thinking MP3 peeps!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Caligula: a Word virus!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>I was watching 
    this amusing little "Doctor Who" story the other night called "The Romans"!!!!!!!!! 
    It was quite good, but I noticed the Doctor forgot to say to the Emperor 
    Nero: <i>"Oh by the way, one of you Emperor dudes will lend his name 
    to a virus on Microsoft Word programs!!!!!!!!!!!!"</i> That's because 
    someone's done an MS Word virus called <b>Caligula</b>!!!!!!!!! It's 
    a bit like that <b>picture.exe</b> trojan (See <a href="22.html#654"> 
    issue 22</a>...) in that it sends some text to someone on tha netweb!!!!!! 
    Only here, it isn't an email address in China!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's actually 
    some website called <b>CodeBreakers</b>, and it sends your PGP keyring, 
    if you have one!!!!!!!!!! It's not much use without your actual PGP 
    passcode, but this CodeBreakers just decided to do this just to show 
    it was possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Gillette can't be too pleased!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>You know that from Gillette for their <i>"Mach 3"</i> razor?!?!?!? You know,
    the one where some young bloke is in this supersonic jet fighter, and when it
    goes to mach 3, suddenly the jet blows up, and all his clothes get ripped
    off!!!! Then he mysteriously turns up in this room where he decides to have a
    shave!!!!!!!!!!! Well, like me, you might be wondering about the logical basis
    behind this advert, but one thing is sure- it'll soon be out of date!!!!!!!!!
    That's because some clever people are working on a plane that is
    capable supersonic flight at the speed of mach *<b>5</b>*!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
    you'll be able to go from Tokyo to Los Angeles in 4 hours!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope
    they'll have enough time to make a quick stop-off at our town tho!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Footballers- goto Zone 14!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Some of you might possibly remember that delightful program <b>"The Twilight
    Zone"</b>!!!!!!!!! (In fact, it has been said by some that I am worthy
    cnadidate for such a zone- which I presume to be some sort of compliment, as
    it certainly makes no sense to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Well, if the presenter Rod
    Serling was a "soccer" player, he might have called it "Zone 14"
    instead!!!!!!!! That's because apparently "Zone 14" is a really really
    important place on the football field during a match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where it
    is I do not know, but apparently that's where the final game of the last world
    Cup was won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's porbably why some of the Brazilian team were
    arguing with each other late in the match!!!!!! They were probably saying:
    "We're not playing in Zone 14 enough, guys!!!!!!!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Shop- from your fridge!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Now, I bet you never thought of your fridge as something you'd take to the
    shop with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, I don't normally do this myself, except of
    course when our local supermarket manager decided to run a jokey "All shopping
    is free if you bring your fridge with you!!!!!!!" type stunt for Red Nose
    Day!!!! (I decided to lay on a van service for all the people at the Old
    Folk's Home so that they could bring their fridges along!!!!!!!! The manager
    wasn't too pleased!!!!!!!!! However, as I explained to the police afterwards,
    the real trouble started when I suggested to the manager that perhaps he ought
    to cheer up a bit and wear a red nose or something, after all it was Red Nose
    Day, wasn't it!!!!!!!!!!!)</p>
  <p>Ahem, anyway!!!!!!!!! If you've never taken the fridge to the shops, you might
    do so in future, and the manager will actually be pleased as well!!!!!!!!
    That's because you're not really taking the fridge to the shops, you're taking
    the shops to your fridge!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Some bright sparks have come up with
    this touch-screen thingy for fridges, called... (Check this original
    name out!!!!!!!) "<b>Fridgescreen</b>", which apparently links to an online
    shopping service!!!!!!!!! Only prob is- what happens if you put those funny
    fridge magnets on the fridge?!?!?!? Won't it erase Fridgescreen's data or
    something like that!??!?!?!</p>

  <h2>Infinite bangs!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Do you ever feel that everyone's "having it off" apart from yourself!??!?!?!?
    Well, don't worry, because there's one "person" whose had more "bangs" than
    anyone else!!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about the Universe!!!!!!! You
    might be thinking: "Wait a sec!!!!!!!!!! Didn't the universe only have one
    really big bang at the start??!?!?!?" Well, er, technically, yes, but
    according to new research, this universe is only one "bubble" that has been
    created out of infinite universe "bubbles" each of which had their own big
    bangs!!!!!!!!!!!!! So we're all the result of an infinite number of
    bangs!!!!!!!! We wouldn't be too surprised if Mary Whitehouse starts
    launching a crusade against astrophysics now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
