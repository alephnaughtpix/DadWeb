    <h1>N-n-n-n-nineteen!!!!! (Cold, isn't it?!?!?)</h1>
    <p>First things first!!!!! How come I've not seen a peep from you
      readers about my request last week for your views on the best
      Senior Citizen stories of this past (half) year?!?!? You can
      mail me you know!!!! You can also send messages to the mailing
      list as well, and have a right old discussion....
    <p>Come on readers, next week's issue is the Xmas one!!!! And after that
      is the review of the year, so let's have some views by then!!!!
      Or else, I'll have to do it all myself!!!!! And you wouldn't
      want that to happen, would you?!?!??!?! No, of course you
      flipping don't!!!!! So get cracking!!!!!</p>
    <p>OK, second things now!!!!! We've got another little re-directy
      address now!!! Goto <a href="http://surf.to/seniordads/">http://surf.to/seniordads/</a> for another way
      into your favourite website!!!! By which we of course mean
      the Senior Dads site!!!!! And even better, using subdirs with
      <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> works!!!! So, to celebrate, given
      that this is issue 19, here's the lyrics for that classic 1980s
      hit by Paul Hardcastle, 19!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Do a spoof- with frames!!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wanted to do a fabby-dabby spoofy filmy like that
    "Lethal Titanic" or whatever it's called?!?!? Well, you might want
    to start by loading up your Netscape/IE/AOL browsey-wowsey with
    frames and javascript!!!!!!!!!! This is because someone's
    discovered that it's quite easy to "spoof" a frames-using site with
    Javascript!!! Someone could make up a page that looks a little like
    the site, and reload it in place of the real page from the site,
    and make it do something like ask for your password, and it's not
    obvious, because the URL in the top of the window points to the
    frameset, not the newly reloaded page!!!! Er, well, at least that's
    what they say here- I don't understand a word of it!!!!!! They do
    have a nice demonstration page tho...</p>

  <h2>Top Ten site- in Belgium!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, if like me, you're almost surfing with an American accent,
    then you'll like this one!!!! It's a TV site- but it's actually for
    European telly, not American stuff!!!!!!!!! Not only that, but it's
    apparently one of the top 10 sites in Belgium!!!! I dunno why they
    class "Can't Cook, Won't Cook" as an "emission" tho...</p>

  <h2>Jon Katz: I don't understand Linux!!!!</h2>
  <p>Jon Katz, the "net" columnist whose columns we keep seeing
    everywhere is obviously getting a little out of his normal depth in
    his Slashdot columns, if his latest is anything to go by!!!!! He's
    presumably getting a little irked by the fact that the Slashdot
    format allows people to comment on his columns right next to them,
    and that a lot of the audience know a lot more about computing
    subjects than he does!!!!! So in his latest column he's actually
    asking for help on Linux!!!! He's of course using the opportunity
    to try and apply it to everyone else, and appeal to knowledgeable
    people to not be so snotty and so on... but he's basically asking
    for help!!!!</p>
  <p>Let's hope he gets it!!!! (Oooh-er crickey officer!!!!) After all, 
    his columns are reasonably well written, and are from a different 
    perspective than the usual "net" journo type stuff- so if he can learn 
    a bit more about "techhy" issues, it can only help things, can't it?!?!?!</p>

  <h2>A Fanpage for... a webpad!!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, we've heard of some strange fan pages before, (Such as that
    Mr T one, eh Mike?!?!?!?) but this takes the biscuit- and the scone
    with jam in it as well!!!!!!!) If you remember that "Webpad"
    thingy that we mentioned not so long ago, (See <a href="18.html#537">issue 18</a>...)
    well, someones made a whole fansite for it, and other similar
    websurfing little computes!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Palm Pilot: as used by car theives?!?!??!!</h2>
  <p>Some of you might have heard about some enterprising young
    ruffians using those funny TV remote control replacement thingies,
    which record the infrared codes zapped out by your old remote
    control, to record the infrared codes used by some car locking
    systems, and unlock them- without a key!!!! Well, some years after
    that, the lovely little Palm Pilot now sports a similar infrared
    "recording" facility for TV users- and guess what!!!! Young
    ruffians are using it to break into cars as well!!!!!</p>
    <p>Well I never!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Future of music: 'bazzar'?!??!?!</h2>
  <p>If you've ever been to a really big church, did you ever think:
    "Aha!!!! This is exactly like Microsoft, and any major record
    label!!!"?!?!?!? And after that, did you go to some car boot sale
    and thought: "Aha!!! Linux!!! And Cliff Richard in the future!!!!"
    Well, perhaps you ought to next time!!!!!! Because apparently
    you've just been watching the future of development models in
    software and popular music!!!!!</p>
  <p>Some open source dude wrote this bloody long essay called <i>"The 
    Cathedral and the Bazzar"</i> in which "big" software companies are 
    apparently cathedrals and open source stuff is a bazzar!!!!!! Well, 
    now another person has written another essay on how it's going to 
    be generally the same for popular music!!!! Which is just as well, 
    since we recently sent a demo of our <a href="../../../music">music</A> 
    to a certain major record company, and they wrote back, calling us 
    laughable!!!! (Presumably because we weren't a "hip" Britpop act with 
    "attitude" and "swagger"!!!!!) Well, they said that about the Beatles!!!!! 
    Well, OK, not exactly, but you know what I mean!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>In any case, if this essay is to be belived, music is going get 
    more "bazzar"!!!!!!!!!! (DOH!!!!!!!!!)</p>

  <h2>Just like a text adventure- without the text!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Do you remember those "Level 9" type adventures with "3 million
    rooms!!!", 2.9999 million of which just happened to be along the
    lines of <i>"You are in a maze. You can't see anything. Exits in
    all directions"</i>?!?!?!? Well, now you can have it with the
    text- in 3D!!!!!!!!! According to this lot, anyway... You have to
    pay money for it tho!!!!!!</p>

  <p>We're still reeling 
    from being called "Wacky Shit" in that zine directory!!!!! (See <a href="18.html#556"> 
    issue 18</A>...) But here's some more of it!!!!!! This "<b>Oddities</b>" 
    site is a bit like the sort of stuff you get in that funny "<b>Bizzare</b>" 
    mag, only you don't have to pay money for it here!!!!!!!! We wouldn't 
    be too surprised if we get listed in it!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <h2>What a load of 'Big Poo'!!!!!</h2>
    <p>Some of you might 
      dimly remember the advert for the musical band <b>Big Poo Generator</b>... 
      (See <a href="14.html#430"> issue 14</A>...) Well, <b>Hemorrhoy Rogers</b> 
      of that very band actually read this very organ, (Fnarr fnarr!!!!!!) 
      and emailed us to request that we write something bad about the band!!!! 
      <i>"It would really help us out if you would say that we suck or something 
      like that."</i> (Especially if quoted in press releases, we imagine!!!!) 
      So here goes!!!!</p>
    <pre class="usenet">I was innocently led to believe from their advert 
that the oddly named <b>BIG POO GENERATOR</b> were similar
in style to Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones!!!! Imagine my 
shock and horror when I visited their disgusting website, 
and found that they were the audio equivalent of South 
Park, without even it's redeeming features!!!! Crudeness
and an obsession with bodily functions seem to be all 
these young ruffians can think about- does the average 
normal God-fearing person in the street really wish to 
know about the singer's half brother's digusting illness,
or that "Mr Poo" is "in you"!??! To mention these 
obscenities in the same breath as Frank Sinatra is not
only inaccurate- it's a moral crime against humanity!!! 
It should be Big Poo Generator in the courts rather than
General Pinochet!!!! (Mind you, gas masks might be 
mandatory for the jurors!!!!!!)</pre>
    <p>Right- is that good enough!??!?!?! I should really listen to your 
      music sometime, Rogers!!!! Just wait till I upgrade my modem from 
      the 300 baud model I have at the mo...</p>

  <h2>Children: you may be 'freightened' by this story!!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, after all 
    that, you may be not too surprised by this story!!! Apparently according 
    to this survey, 40% of kids have seen something "rude" on the net!!!! 
    (As opposed to Channel 5, presumably!!!!!) And that's not all!!!!! One 
    in seven saw pages that "freightened them"!!!!!!!!! Now this is something 
    I've never heard of!!!! Children being turned into freight containers!!!!!! 
    A seventh of all kids going up and down the country transporting corporate 
    goods because they saw something on the net!!!!!!! Surely this netweb 
    thingy is dangerous and ought to be banned!!!!!!! (Apart from us of 
    course!!!!! And, erm, the internet, because we, like, report on it, 
    don't we?!??!?!!)</p>

  <h2>Frank Black- on tha NetWeb!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Well, this might 
    make the inpho-pipe-web a little safer for kids.... If you regularly 
    watch that nice man <b>Frank Black</b> in that spooky TV series <b>Millenium</b>, 
    you might know that he searches for naughty men by "profiling" them!!!!! 
    What you might not know is that some company has just announced it's 
    going to do the same!!!! Yep, they're going to "profile" your netweb 
    surfing data!!!!!! Presumably to see if you're a serial killer or something...</p>

    could do better than them!!!!"</i> I know I have!!!! Well, apparently 
    now you can do better- by making your own CD!!!!! And this helpful little 
    article will tell you how to do it!!!!! (Erm, actually you really need 
    a CD writer to make a CD!!!!! So don't try making it without a CD writer!!!!!!

  <p>Whilst you're 
    grooving to the latest episode of Teletubbies, let's not forget the 
    1970s, equivalent, Playschool!!!! To help you bring back the days of 
    "Big Ted" and "Hambel", here's a really Playschool-like "dialogue" from 
    the <b>Daily Yomiuri</b> about artificial intelligence!!!!! All you 
    need now is someone to do the "tinkly" bits on a piano!!!! </p>
  <pre class="usenet">Susan: I've been thinking a lot about thinking lately.
[Piano goes tinkly-winkly!!!]
Cathy: What do you mean?
[Piano goes tinkle-winkle!!!]
Susan: I've been wondering what it means to be intelligent, 
and whether any of the computers we're building here in 
Silicon Valley will ever be as smart as you and I.

  <h2>Portals: not really used as portals!!!!!</h2>
  <p>Hopefully this 
    flipping hype about portals is finally beginning to die down a bit now!!!! 
    Last week, we told about an 11 year-old running her own portal, (See 
    <a href="18.html#549"> issue 18</a>...) now we have this survey that 
    says that people tend to use portals for reading the news!!!! Given 
    that the news sections tend to be just an add-on to the average portal, 
    that tells you quite a lot!!!!!!!!! But not that much of it has apparently 
    got through to the people who wrote this press release!!!!! By their 
    arguments, this esteemed organ must be a portal as well!!!!!!</p>
  <p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/jupiter_co_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/981208/jupiter_co_1.html</a></p>

    predicts that if it's still around next year, it'll be covering loadsa

  <h2>Frank Sinatra: a 'cowardly' 'hoodlum'?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>Well, now that 
    the old singer (Who I'm sure does not really sound like Big Poo Generator!!!!!) 
    has kicked the bucket, the FBI have released all their wads of paperwork 
    on the ex-singer!!!!!! Now, the former "pipes" man might have wowed 
    people the world over with his "doobedoobedoo" technique on "Strangers 
    in the Night", but he doesn't seem to have been too friendly with the 
    Feds!!!! One of the "reports" on him even offers the opinion that he 
    would have been a 'hoodlum' if he wasn't so 'cowardly'!!!!!!! This Edgar 
    Hoover person who was running the FBI at the time (Long before Scully 
    and Mulder!!!) seems to be a really "sore" person!!!! Mind you, it must 
    be difficult being the son of the man who invented the vacuum cleaner!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>Well, no doubt 
    whilst reading this spiffy issue of Senior Citizen, you are probably 
    using the mouse very vigourously!!!!!!! But, you'd better be careful, 
    or else it may have a heart attack!!! That's because it may be older 
    than you!!!! Unless you're over 30 of course!!! Yes, that's right- the 
    mouse was invented 30 years ago this week!!!!! And it's being written 
    up in a whole load of people, most of whom probably thought trackballs 
    were really brilliant 10 years ago!!!!</p>

  <p>Have you ever 
    been walking in the Texas plains, got bit by a rattlesnake, and thought: 
    "Hmmm!!!! Those Mozilla people should really be taking notes here if 
    they want to fit their browser onto a single floppy disk!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!?!? 
    Well, obviously someone has, because the first major new release from 
    the Mozilla open source thingy is this thingy called "<b>Gecko</b>", 
    (Which is of course named after those fabulous series of video games!!!) 
    which is a really small browser and HTML rendering engine thingy, which 
    fits on a floppy when zipped!!!!!! Apparently, this is going to be part 
    of the new Netscape v5 browsey-wowsey!!!!! You'll probably need to download 
    an "antidote" with it in case it bites you tho!!!!</p>

  <p>Now I bet you 
    didn't know that some scientests were doing a "Sloan Sky Survey"!!!! 
    Even more, amazing, they're not doing it from Sloane Square, but from 
    the Hubble Telescope!!!!!!!!! In this story, they've found these things 
    called "quasars", (Which sounds like an early 80s yuppy wine bar, doesn't 
    it?!?!?!?) and one in particular is apparently the furthest known visible 
    object in space!!!!! Apparently it's got a "redshift" of 5.0!!!!!! What 
    that means, we don't know- but it sounds pretty far from Sloane Square 
    anyway!!!!!!!!</p>

  <h2>Elvis: his relationship with Beavis!??!?!</h2>
  <p>I suppose you're 
    waiting for me to say something like "Well, now I've got your attention, 
    here's the real story!!!!" or something crap like that!!!!! Well, I'm 
    not going to do that!!!! I really am going to talk about the relationship 
    between Beavis (out of "Beavis & Butthead") and Elvis Presley!!!!</p>
  <p>OK, here goes... Beavis is in "Beavis & Butthead", which was created 
    by Mike Judge. He appeared in the movie "Airheads" who also starred 
    Nina Siemaszko. She appeared in the move "The Long Way Home", which 
    also starred Ed Asner. And Ed Asner appeared in "Change of Habit", 
    with... (drum roll!!!) Elvis Presley!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Yes, it's that type of website!!!! In the "<b>Oracle of Elvis</b>" 
    website, you can type in any old name, and find out their connection 
    to "Mr Rock 'n' Roll Cheeseburger"!!!! Unfortunately, when I tried 
    to find out my connection to the very talented movie actor, it didn't 
    work!!!!! I'll have to email them to remind them that I of course 
    shouted "That Colonel Tom Parker will be the death of you!!!" at him 
    when I was a baggage attendant at Prestwick airport, which was coincidentelly 
    the scene of Presley's only UK "gig"!!!! He said something like "Sort 
    it out!!!", which I took to be an offer to be his new manager!!!!! 
    At which point some big bloke ran towards me looking a little angry, 
    then I saw a lot of stars, and when I woke up, Elvis had left the 
    building!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Incidentelly, if you've been watching the very nice cable channel 
    "Cartoon Network", you might have noticed that one of their adverts 
    uses a similar "connections" game- only it's not with Elvis, it's 
    with Thelma out of Scooby Doo!!!!! We wonder how long it's going to 
    be before their website does an "Oracle of Thelma"?!?!?!?</p>

  <h2>Never heard of this 'trailer'- what is it again?!?!?!</h2>
  <p>What do you mean 
    you're sick of the Star Wars trailer already?!?!? Well, you have to 
    "unsick" yourselves!!!! If you're going to the cinema this Xmas, you're 
    probably going to be seeing it again!!!! It's going to appear in selected 
    UCI movie theatres from Dec 16!!! If you're going to a UCI cinema to 
    the see "<b>The Mask Of Zorro</b>", and you wonder why the queues to 
    get in are so incredibly long, then now you know!!!!!!</p>
  <p>You can spend the long hours waiting until that happens by downloading 
    "augmented" versions of the trailer from this helpful little site, 
    which includes mirrors to loadsa trailers as well as loads of "unusual" 
    versions, such as the "camcorder" one, and a "stereo pro-logic" version!!!!!!!!</p>
