        <p class="intro"><b>THIS</b> rather amazing freeware production is the debut by the Senior Dads into
            the world of multipart demos. At first sight it offers little - a jumble
            of chaotic effects, caterwaul music and scrawled graphics. however, the
            humour behind the demo soon seeps through, and by the end you're laughing
            along with it - well I was! I suspect this demo is best enjoyed in company
            of some like-minded friends. The highlight for me was the mini punk rock
            revival right at the end, with animations and music which puts to shame
            anything else that describes itself as 'multi-tedia'! Air dirt isn't going
            to win many friends among those who consider demo watching a waste of time
            but demo fans should get the joke and appreciate their efforts. Probably
            one of the best designed and produced releases of the last year!</p>
