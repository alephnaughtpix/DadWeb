<h1>Grelb is dead!!!!!</h1>
<p>Some of the people on the mailing list might know about this
      already, but for the benefit of everyone else, it's been a bit of an
      exciting week for the Senior Dads website- or rather the server the website
      is sitting on!!! By the time you're reading this, the Grelb server, which has
      housed the Senior Dads webpages since 1995 may be out of service, and our
      pages may be on a completely different server!!! Of course, if you're
      reading this on the website, you'll know if the pages are still on Grelb
      or not, but they're going to be off the Grelb server by the end of the month
      anyway!!!</p>
<p>This sudden move is not being made by us, but by the people who run Grelb,
      and the reason is academic politics!!!! As some of you might have noticed,
      the Grelb server was situated in the Glasgow Uni domain- this was because
      it was started up as a little project by Glasgow Uni students, including one
      of our friends, who maintains the SD site!!! Since then, nearly all the
      students have left Uni... Now there's pretty strict guidelines on use of
      facilities on the JANET network, so obviously sooner or later questions
      would be asked about the Grelb site, which was mostly used by non-students
      and had a lot of "third-party" pages (eg our site!!!)!!!! So just in time
      for the new term, the dudes at Grelb have decided to shut down Grelb, and
      relocate it to another machine outside JANET!!! This is supposed to happen
      on the very day this issue is released, but if it doesn't, it'll happen
      eventually anyway by the end of the month!!!!</p>
<p>Grelb users have been warned that the new machine will have a lower bandwith
      connection, and that it's only really medium-term, so we might have to look
      for a new site ourselves anyway!!! (Anyone know of any site which allows CGI
      progs and server-side includes?!?!?!?)</p>
