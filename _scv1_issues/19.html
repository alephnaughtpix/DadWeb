<h1>N-n-n-n-nineteen!!!!! (Cold, isn't it?!?!?)</h1>
<p>First things first!!!!! How come I've not seen a peep from you
      readers about my request last week for your views on the best
      Senior Citizen stories of this past (half) year?!?!? You can
      mail me you know!!!! You can also send messages to the mailing
      list as well, and have a right old discussion....
    <p>Come on readers, next week's issue is the Xmas one!!!! And after that
      is the review of the year, so let's have some views by then!!!!
      Or else, I'll have to do it all myself!!!!! And you wouldn't
      want that to happen, would you?!?!??!?! No, of course you
      flipping don't!!!!! So get cracking!!!!!</p>
<p>OK, second things now!!!!! We've got another little re-directy
      address now!!! Goto <a href="http://surf.to/seniordads/">http://surf.to/seniordads/</a> for another way
      into your favourite website!!!! By which we of course mean
      the Senior Dads site!!!!! And even better, using subdirs with
      <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> works!!!! So, to celebrate, given
      that this is issue 19, here's the lyrics for that classic 1980s
      hit by Paul Hardcastle, 19!!!!!!!</p>
