<h1>Buy Sky Digital, or your telly will jump off a cliff!!!</h1>
<p>This is the second time I've 
      written an editorial for this newsletter, and I've not had any idea of what 
      to put in the editorial!!!!! I mean, there's nothing happening on the "Grelb 
      move" front and the custom mailing list proggy is not ready yet, so tehre's 
      nothing else I can think of yet!!!!!! Argh!!!!!!!</p>
<p>OK then, I have thought of something... By the end of 1998, I'll be wanting
      to do some sort of review of the year (Alright then, half year!!!!!!) so start
      thinking of your favourite stories so far, and I'll be asking you readers
      (especially you bunch in the mailing list!!!!) in a month or two to name your
      fave rave!!!!! (OK, fave story then!!!!!!!) So start looking!!!!</p>
