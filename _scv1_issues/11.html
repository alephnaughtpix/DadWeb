<h1>The Phantom Menace!!!!!</h1>
<p>Yes, that's what the new Star Wars film is called!!!!! What do you
      mean it sounds crap?!?!?!?! Well, what about "The Empire Strikes Back"
      then!??! Ha!!! Knocked a whole in your argument there!!!!!</p>
<p>Erm, anyway- the setting up of the "proper" mailing list is being slightly
      delayed because we're finishing off our classic ASCII remix of "Space
      Invaders"!!!! It'll work on Atari computers, and probably the Pacifist
      emulator on da PC!!!! Anyway, I'm doing a couple of tests of a mailing
      device from the existing SDWWWHQ, so it won't be too long!!!!</p>
<p>Incidentelly, this Grelb move I was talking about a couple of weeks 
      ago (See <a href="9.html#"> issue 9</a>...) seems to be taking a lot longer 
      than expected... It's already October, and Fresher's Week has just ended 
      at Glasgow Uni, and it's still not moved!!!! But it'll probably move soon, 
      so keep using the <b>seniordads.home.ml.org</b> address!!!</p>
