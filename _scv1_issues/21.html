<h1>Oh my God, they've killed 1998!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>Wow!!!!! Who would have guessed that we would have made it
      to 1999?!?!?!? Erm, well, I would have!!!!!! Because I had to write this
      issue!!!!!!!! Even more amazing, it's our 21st issue!!!!! That means as
      a magazine, Senior Citizen is now old enough to become an MP!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got a couple of new years resolutions as regards Senior Citizen...</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a bit of re-designing on the general look!!!!!!</li>
<li>Make the archive section a bit better!!!!</li>
<li>Get a slightly more reliable mailing list for the email version
        of Senior Citizen!!!!!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm also intending to make my own side of the making of an issue a bit
      easier and more convenient!!!!! (That would a good thing!!!!) I'll be
      doing a couple of tests of the mini re-design soon, but I'll tell you
      nearer the time!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So, happy new year and all that!!!!!!! Now read the first issue of 1999!!!!</p>
