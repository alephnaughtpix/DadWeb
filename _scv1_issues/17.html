<h1>The saga begins: Spring 1999!!!!</h1>
<p>No we are not going to mention that "trailer"!!!!!!!
      And we thought it would just be Linux geek propellor-head nerds who
      would go on about it, but no!!!! I woke up this (Friday) morning, and saw
      the flipping "Star Wars: Episode One/Phanton Menace" trailer being
      shown on Breakfast TV!!!!!!!!! I almost choked on my porridge in
      surprise!!!!!!!!!!!! So- no more mention of flipping Star Wars!!!!!!</p>
<p>Erm, OK then... We'll mention it once!!!!!!! But at least the
      story is a little more interesting!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>OK, enough of the SW bull-doody!!!!!!!!!!! This is much more
      important!!!!!! The first story in this issue is story no. 500!!!!
      Yes, that's right!!!! We've now passed the 500 story mark with this
      issue!!! Amazing, isn't it?!?!!? Those people who said when we
      started that we couldn't last were wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Erm... Well...
      Actually no-one's really said that, because not very many people
      read Senior Citizen when it first came out!!!! But if anyone did
      say that, they'd be wrong anyway!!!!!!! So there!!!!</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing!!!!! As you might notice from one of the news
      stories, you can't get through to <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> <b>OR</b>
<a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> at the moment!!!!! Luckily Grelb hasn't
      shut down or moved to a different server as they were threatening
      recently, so the special "long" Grelb URL still works!!!!!!!! (Well,
      at the moment, anyway!!!!!! Don't want to tempt fate!!!!!!)</p>
