<h1>Official!!! Furbies are security threats!!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>Woops!!!!!!! Sorry for that break in publication last week, but I
      was really busy on this presentation thingy!!!!!! You see, I got an
      interview for some job thingy at a university place, and it was for
      some job about learning using computers or some such lark!!!!!!!! So
      I had to do a presentation about learning on the Internet, and I
      spent a long time working on it!!!!!!!! Unfortunately, I think I came
      across as a little too forceful!!!!! After all there's only so many
      times you can say "Shut up and stop talking, you idiots!!!!" isn't there?!?!?</p>
<p>Anyway, I've also been working hard on my brilliant editing suite for
      this publication, and I've now got the first version working!!!! And this is is the first issue edited on it!!!!!!!!! So,
      there should be less spelling mistakes from now on, as I can edit the stories in the databse a little easier now!!!! Even
      more interesting is that very soon, we'll have done 666 stories!!!!!!
      So hopefully we won't be taken over by the Devil before the next
      issue!!!!!!!!!!</p>
