<h1>National Smile Week!!!</h1>
<p>Well, that was a very nice little trek around the islands of Scotland!!!
      And now, I'm back!!! And... What!!! You notice the difference?!?!? Yep,
      I've been tinkering around with the look a little, so don't be surprised
      if you see a few more changes!!!! (If you're reading this in email, you'd
      better come to the website or else!!!!)</p>
<p>Now that the number of articles has broke the 100 mark, I've also added an
      archive of all the articles featured!!! Great thing database programming,
      isn't it!?!?</p>
<p>BTW I'm wondering if I should change the title of this organ slightly, as some people
      might have never heard of the <a href="../../../"><b>Senior Dads</b></a>,
      and so might be confused by the title "<b>Senior Citizen</b>"!!! Colostomy Bag
      has suggested I might change the title to "<b>Senior Netzien</b>". What do you
      think!??!</p>
