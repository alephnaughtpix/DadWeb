<p>What do you mean it looks a bit crap?!?!?! Look, I've got enough
      material for a flippin' issue, so I think I'd be better getting out an issue
      that looks crap ATM but is really brilly in terms of content!!! And I'm
      working on the look proper anyway!!!! Oh yeah, and hopefully, some sort
      of mailing thingy as well!!! So don't say I'm not bothering my rear,
      because I am!!! Look, just read the flippin' thing will you!!!!!!</p>
