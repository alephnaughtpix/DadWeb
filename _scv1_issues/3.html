<h1>http://www.whitehouse.com/ is actually a porn site!!!</h1>
<p>The mailing list works!!!!! Only one prob- it's very very sllloooowww!!!!! By
      the time you'll read this, it'll probably be Saturday or something!!! I'm
      getting a little proggy together that might speed up the mailing, so by
      next week, I might have some interesting news for you readers!!! I'm also
      testing the new(er) look, and it'll hopefully be ready by the next issue
      as well!!! So, you'd better hold onto your seats next weekend after next
      weekend, and keep the heart pills at the ready!!!!</p>
<p>Er, BTW, when I say "next weekend after next weekend", I mean it!! I'm having
      a little mini holiday from Wed 29 Jul - Sat 1 Aug, so no issue then because
      I'll not have collected enough guff for anything apart from a very very
      tiny issue!!! So next issue is probably out on Aug 7/8th!!! See you then!!!</p>
