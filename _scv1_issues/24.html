<h1>This Is Your Bloody (Late!!!) Valentine!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>This a lot later than I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because I was upgrading
    some of the system on the Senior Dads Linux box "<b>Godzilla</b>"!!!!!!!!
    We had to get a lot of things fixed on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, our fave
    Tux Box (!!!!! In fact, it's our only one!!!!!!!!!!!!!) is now running that
    spiffy desktop for Linux, <b>KDE</b>!!!!! It's great!!!!!!!!!! It's like the
    nice GUI features of Windows, but it's based on a stable operating which
    doesn't crash all the time!!!!!!!! (I've heard at <b>ZDnet</b> have had a
    similarly nice time when they were reviewing Linux!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently they
    were really amazed that it didn't crash at all while they were reviewing
    it!!!!!!!!) </p>
<p>Anyway, that's why it's a week late!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is that you're saying:
    you thought it was two weeks late!??!?!?! Well, I was attempting to add a
    network card in my computers that week!!!!!!!!!!!! It was an extremely
    hard job- and when I get the bloody thing working, I'll let you know in a
    future issue of Senior Citzen!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, here was the editorial I
    wrote a week ago....</p>
<p>Pah!!!!!! Valentine's day!!!!!! Who needs it!?!??!?!?!? If you thought Xmas
    or Easter was a bit commercialised, then you've obviously forgotten about
    this day!!!!!!!!!! Is there really anything to Valentines day other than
    buying some crappy card or box of chocolates?!?!?!?! (Both of which are at
    hiked-up prices!!!!!!!) Not that I can see!!!!!!!! You can do that any time
    of the year, so why is 14th February so flippin' special?!?!?!? I mean, I
    know it's traditional, but you could say the same about slavery or
    diptheria, and I don't see too many people mourning the passing of either,
    do you?!?!?!?!?!? And this "anonymous" business is really stupid as well!!!!
    If you really want to have it off with someone, how on Earth can you
    do "it" without knowing who the other flippin' person is, or vice-versa?!?!
    Even in the non-"having it off" stakes, sending cards anonymously to
    someone hardly amounts to what I would call a flippin' healthy romantic
    relationship!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>What do you mean "You're listening to that anti-Valentine compil CD that came
    free with this week's <b>Melody Maker</b>, aren't you!!!!!!!"!?!??!?!? Erm,
    well, yes, but it's actually a really good one!!!!! I mean, I don't exactly
    remember the last time MM gave away a free tape or CD which included Fear
    Factory and Sepultura, as opposed to the usual tepid indie bollocks!!!!!!!
    Probably the best giveaway from MM since their infamous "Romo" tape!!!!!!</p>
