<h1>Double Digit Salute!!!!!</h1>
<p>Yes!!!!!!!!!
    <p>We've made to issue 10!!!!!! A bit late because we were at the <b>Reservoir
      Cwmvention 1998</b> last week, but here it is!!!</p>
<p>Another piece of good news!!!! You notice that little "webring" thingy on
      the left column of the webpage!!!!! Yes, that's right!!!!! We're on an ezine
      webring!!!! OK, you've probably been noticing it for the past couple of weeks,
      but it didn't quite work properly because we weren't actually accepted into
      it yet!!!! But now we're finally on the <b>E-zine Webring</b>, after a wait
      of about 3 weeks!!!! We were wondering why it was taking so long- then we
      realised that we forgot to send an email to the admin of the webring!!!!!!
      But that's fixed now!!!!</p>
<p>One ultra-annoying thing tho- in the past couple
      of weeks, the Coollist mailing list server which SC transmits it's email
      versh on has gone into meltdown!!! It's probably due to that "Clinton"
      business being discussed on a couple of mailing lists, but when Coollist
      finally resurrected itself earlier this week, it had imposed a 20K limit on
      messages, which means I'll probably need to split the email versh into two
      parts!!!! Bah!!!!!!</p>
