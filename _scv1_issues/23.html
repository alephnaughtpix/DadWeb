<h1>Big Brother Inside!??!?!?</h1>
<p>There are a lot of people at the moment knocking Glen Hoddle because of
      his remarks about disabled people!!!!!!!!! Well, OK, the comments were a bit
      "off" to say the least, but I really think people should leave him alone!!!!
      After all, an ability to put one's foot in one's mouth so spectacularly is
      obviously a punishment for sins in a previous life, isn't it?!?!?!??!! (Ho
      ho!!!!!)</p>
<p>I noticed something else this week!!!!!! And it begs a question: who decided
      that Hot Chocolate were hip again?!??!?! Not that I'm complaining of course,
      but I'm starting to see Hot Chocolate "Greatest Hits" compils appearing out
      of nowhere, and now their singer Errol Brown's popped up, singing their late
      70s ballad "I'll Put You Back Togther Again" on an ad for hot chocolate
      (Boom boom!!!) drinks!!!!</p>
<p>And this is not the first time the band have become hip again!!!! They did
      it before (twice!!!!!!) in the 80s!!!!!!! There must be some comittee
      somewhere that decides these things!!!!!!! And I'd like to get in contact
      with them, in order to get advance warning so that next time I can dig out
      all my old Hot Choclate records from the attic, and make everyone think I'm
      really hip!!!!!!!!!!</p>
