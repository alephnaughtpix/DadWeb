<h1>The One Where We Don't Mention 'Velvet Goldmine'!!!!</h1>
<p>Well, again I don't 
      have too much to write here!!!!! The main reason I've done too much yet 
      is that I'm just starting on a lovely little "re-education" course about 
      learning how to use Windows NT!!!!! Considering that the next versh of NT 
      (5!!!) is going to the official Windows 2000 (As announced this Tuesday!), 
      I would say that this is time well spent- and the chance of getting a nice 
      pay packet is not too off-putting either!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, as you might have noticed, there's going to be no mention of
      that film that they keep going on about on the TV!!!!! If you think
      I'm going to do any promotion of a film where that MacGregor chappie
      doing a poor impersonation of Iggy Pop in one of those films made by
      people who like to pretend that 70s were better than they actually
      were!!!!! Well, believe it or not, the 70s weren't that brilliant!!!!
      It might surprise younger readers for me to say this, but people did
      not dress like extras from a Pulp video!!!! And the music
      was pretty terrible as well!!!! When the highlight in a 70s TOTP is
      Abba knocking Manhattan Transfer off the number 1 spot (And that was in
      1977- right in the middle of punk!!!!), you know something's wrong
      somewhere!!!!!! I don't know what 1970s these "media" types are
      referring to as "fashionable", but I can safely say that people were
      fashionable in the 70s in the same way that people were hippies in
      the 1960s!!!!! (ie not at all for 99% of the population!!!!!)</p>
<p>Ah well!!!! I suppose MacGregor can afford to pick crappy roles!!!!
      After all, by this time next year, he'll probably be forever known
      as Mr Anakin Skywalker!!!!!</p>
