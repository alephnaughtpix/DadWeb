<h1>EEE!!!! (The Prequel!!!)!</h1>
<p>Now we're a really established newsletter (Well, we've done 4 issues,
      so there!!!!!!), here's the prequel!!! Or rather, one of them!!! I
      posted the URL of <a href="text/horse.txt">loadsa wierd stories</a> before one David Deans said
      why don't I start a news letter with all that sort of stuff?!?! So
      I did!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, here's one of the posts I did before all that!!! A little report 
      about E3!!! And I wasn't even there!!!!! But Wired News was!!!! The original 
      Usenet message this was made from is at <a href="text/e3.txt">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/features/citizen/text/e3.txt</a>.</p>
