<h1>This edition has been disinfected before distribution!!!</h1>
<p>If you're going to expect me to say "Cough!!! Cough!!!! Splutter!!! etc",
      then you're wrong!!!!!! I'm hardly coughing now!!!!! In fact, I should be
      really occasionally going "Bllleeeuuurggghhh!!!!" as that's what tends to happen
      now if I'm a bit too active!!!!!!! (Why are you looking at me like that!??!?!!)
      Well, at least I'm up and well enough to finish yet another brilliant issue
      of this fantastic brilliant (Oh no, I've already used the word "brilliant", and...
      Oh no!!!!! I've used "brilliant" again!!!!! Anyway... Oh phooey!!! I've used...
      OK, I'll stop it now!!!!!!!!!!!) Senior Citizen!!!!
    <p>Right!!!!! First thing- don't go to 
      <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> !!!! Why!?!?!?
      Because it doesn't work any more!!!!!!! See the story later in the issue... Use
      the Grelb addr or <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> , and we hope to have another
      snappy redirect addr soon!!!!</p>
<p>Second!!!! I'm wanting your views on what's the best stories of the year!!!! If you've
      got an opinion, send it to us at 
      <a href="mailto://senior@forfree.at">mailto://senior@forfree.at</a> ... Or better still,
      if you're a member of the mailing list, why not send your suggestions to the list,
      and let's have a discussion?!?!?! So when you've finished this brilliant issue, why
      not have a look at the previous equally brilliant issues and suggest your fave
      stories?!?!?!</p>
