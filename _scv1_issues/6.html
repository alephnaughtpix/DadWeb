<h1>Monica Lewinsky- What's she going to look like with a chimney on her!?!?!?</h1>
<p>Well, it might not seem as big as last week, but
      my computer was away for a day and a half getting fixed!!! Now
      I don't have to bang it to get it to work!!!!! Actually, if
      this issue *<b>does</b>* seem as big as last week, you can ignore this paragraph!!!!!!</p>
<p>If some of you tried to get on the website last weekend, you might have 
      had trouble, as both the <a href="http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/" target="">Grelb</a> 
      server and the name server for the Senior Dads site went down!!!!! But 
      it's okay now- and anyway, I've got a backup server in case the Grelb 
      one goes down... Yes, it's happened before!!!! Just before the weekend 
      we launched our <b><a href="../../../demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a></b> 
      demo, our website went down!!! So, I quickly registered at one of the 
      zillions of free website hosting thingies, and made up the <b><a href="http://members.theglobe.com/seniordads/">Senior 
      Dads But 'n' Ben</a></b> site, and redirected the nameserver there!!! 
      The only reason I didn't do it again last week was that the bloody nameserver 
      was also broken down!!!! Bah!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, contrary to expectations, the mailing list edition of Senior Citizen still
      works!!!! So you email guys probably won't have noticed any difference!!!! So I
      probably wasted my time typing this!!! Doh!!!!!!!!</p>
