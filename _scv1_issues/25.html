<h1>Playstation 2: Yawn!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>This is a bit of a strange 
      issue, because it looks like our web server on <b>Grelb</b> really <i>is</i> 
      shutting down now, after that false alarm stuff last year!!!!!! (See <a href="9.html"> 
      issue 9</a>...) They're supposed to be shutting down on <b>Fri 5 March</b> 
      and moving to a new server at <a href="http://grelb.wasters.com/">http://grelb.wasters.com/</a> 
      , but I don't know if they've done that yet, at the time of writing!!!!!!!!! 
      One thing will be sure, all you lucky email list people will probably be 
      getting this issue first!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
