<h1>Xmas- it's a blast!!!!!</h1>
<p>Wow!!!!! We made it to Xmas!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Now you might call me paranoid, but... Don't you think the timing of this
      attack on Iraq, at the same time as the impeachment hearings, is a bit of a
      coincidence!??!?!?!?! Now I don't wish to be scaremongering or anything, but
      I think President Clinton started the attack to divert attention from the
      impeachment hearings!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>After the mailing list delayed the last issue by a couple of days, I
      thought it might be a neat idea to make up my own mailer proggy!!!! I'm
      currently writing the flippin' thing, and I'll be testing it soon...</p>
<p>Anyway, Merry Christmas to you lot, and all that jazz!!!! Have a nice time,
      and make sure you watch the "Davey" Bond movie!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
