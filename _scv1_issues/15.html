<h1>Dress up in 'Planet of the Apes' costumes, then greet John Glenn when he comes back!!!!!</h1>
<p>Have you noticed?!?!?!? Yes, we've got a banner at the top of the webpage
      now!!!!! That means that loads of people are going to see our spiffy banner!!!!! What
      do you mean, you can't see it?!?!?! OK then, go here:
    <p>
<a href="{{"/features/citizen/v1/banners/citizen.gif"|relative_url}}">http://seniordads.atari.org/features/citizen/banners/citizen.gif</a>
</p>
      You might have also noticed that we've got another name as well as the <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org">http://seniordads.home.ml.org</a> one!!!!!
      In fact, we've had the <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> name for a couple of months now, but we haven't used as
      much because originally it wasn't able to handle additional directories appended to the
      name... But now it can!!!!!! And as the dude from DHS said on IRC, it's less likely to
      be down than the home.ml.org address, so if the home.ml.org addr doesn't work, try
      replacing it with "atari.org"!!!!!!</p>
