<h1>'Cuban Boy' is really Noel Gallagher &amp; Paul Weller!!!</h1>
<p>Well, some of you managed to come here for the first issue anyway!!! But
      there's this "when is it going to be done as a mailing list"??!?! stuff!!!
      Look, I'm flipping doing that so shut up!!! Anyway, I've set up a little
      mailing list for discussion and stuff. You can log onto here, but just in
      case some thing funny happens, here's the hard way to do it!!!!
    <p>Go to <a href="http://www.coollist.com/">http://www.coollist.com/</a> , and goto the little bitty which says
      subscribe to a mailing list, put "seniornetzien" in the list name, and
      then put your email addr in the email field (well, er, I think so!!!)!!!<p>
      Anyway, my main acheievment this week is to totally abstract the story
      and issue format to hell, and stuck all the stories in a database, so
      I just need to run a couple of proggies and hey presto- fully formed
      issues of Senior Citizen!!! Now I just need to plug in a new look...</p>
