<h1>Sony Handycam allows you to see through clothes!!!!</h1>
<p>Well, readers on email might notice the difference!!!
      It's now readable!!!! Yep, sorry for all that "two massive columns running into
      each other" type formatting on the last edition- I just took the HTML version I
      stick on the webpage and saved it as text file!!!! In fact, I had to alter the
      flippin' HTML page as for some reason it could save as text because of all
      the funny complex tables and formatting. In fact, the HTML versh might need
      a bit of 'WebLint', as there appears to be one or two odd errors that crop
      up, most notably the amazing propensity for the lovely GM theme by Mozart
      to crash Netscape if being reloaded from the cache!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, I've made a nice clean template especially for email readers, so
      whenever I set the "issue compilation" rolling, it makes up a nice text
      version which manages not to wraparound like a mad wraparound thingy!!!!
      Next I'll probably try fixing the HTML stuffs...</p>
<p>BTW I haven't heard any noises yet about the possible name change to "Senior
      Netzien"!!! Is anyone particularly opposed to it?!?!</p>
