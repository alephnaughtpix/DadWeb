<h1>If you read this issue (Your life will be better)!!!!!</h1>
<p>I'm writing this little bit on tha Fri 13th!!!!!!!!! Woo!!!! I
      thought all that guff about it being unlucky was, erm, guff!!!! But when I
      was on that little NT course that I'm on, all of the NT computers refused to
      work properly!!!!! And then I decided to take an afternoon nap, and when I
      woke up, it was late and every one had gone home!!!!! And I hadn't even
      finished this issue!!!! So after about an hour spent getting my disk out of
      the funny disk drive on the computer, I let myself out of the room, and then
      got stopped by the security people, and had to spend an inordinate amount
      of time explaining why I wasn't a burglar!!!!! Then I ran to the bus stop,
      and found I'd missed the bus!!!!!!! Then the second bus got hit by a
      meteorite!!!!! So I had to walk home!!!!!!!! I've just arrived, and there's
      only 5 more minutes of this day to go, so at least not much can go wrong
      now!!! so, without furTHER ADO, HERE'S THE NEXT ISSUE OF sENIOR cITIZEN...
      Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
