<h1>The magazine equivalent of 'Saving Private Ryan'!!!!</h1>
<p>I've been doing a little "promoting" 
      of <b>Senior Citizen</b> recently!!! I've recently got it added to John 
      Labovitz's Ezine Directory, (See <a href="3.html#63"> issue 3</a>...) and 
      submitting it to loads of search engines... One little effect of this is 
      that I've got the zine onto the Umich Etext Archives in it's own little 
      directory!!!! So you can now get back issue of the email edition of Senior 
      Citizen at: </p>
<p><a href="ftp://etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Zines/Senior_Citizen/">ftp://etext.archive.umich.edu/pub/Zines/Senior_Citizen/</a></p>
<p>And we've got own little archive on the main SD website at:</p>
<p><a href="ezine/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/features/citizen/ezine/</a></p>
<p>So all you new readers don't need to miss out!!!!</p>
