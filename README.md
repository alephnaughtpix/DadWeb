# DadWeb

### Putting the Jekyll into the Senior Dads legacy website.

[https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/DadWeb/](https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/DadWeb/)

This is a partially complete recreation of the Senior Dads original website from about the early 2000s. The Senior Dads were an infamous demo crew, mainly centered on the Atari platform, that also launched a blog called "Senior Citizen" that was hosted on the original website. The website was originally hosted on a server in the University of Glasgow, then it was moved to a Freeserve account by the early 2000s.

This recreation uses Jekyll to recreate the content and style of the original site whilst streamlining the archaic HTML, and implementing modern CSS.

### Completed

* Landing page
* Crew pages
* Music page
* Graphics page
* Demo pages up to "The Air Dirt Demo".
* All the original Features section, up to version 1 of "[Senior Citizen](https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/DadWeb/features/citizen/)", which covers the period from June 1998 to March 1999.
* Added a new [section for updates](https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/DadWeb/updates/).

### To be completed

* All the demo pages. (Including adding one for the 2015 JS/CODEF/Canvas demo "The 'Def Demo".)
* Adding posts from version 2 of "Senior Citizen", which covers (in fits and bursts) the period from September 2000 to January 2009.
